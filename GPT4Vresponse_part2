Alright, let's solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:** Identify the triangles formed by the midpoints.
Since M, N, and P are midpoints, we have 4 smaller congruent right triangles: 
1) ΔANP
2) ΔBPM
3) ΔCNM
4) ΔCMP

Each of these triangles is half the size of the larger triangles that contain them (e.g., ΔANP is half the size of ΔACB).

**Step 2:** Relate the area of ΔANP to the area of ΔABC.
Given that ΔANP has an area of 2 cm^2, and since ΔANP is one-fourth the area of ΔABC (because ΔANP is 1 of the 4 smaller triangles that make up ΔABC), we can express the area of ΔABC as:

Area of ΔABC = 4 × Area of ΔANP
                    = 4 × 2 cm^2
                    = 8 cm^2

Thus, the area of ΔABC is 8 cm^2.

Sure! The diagram shows a sector of a circle with a central angle of 60°. We want to determine the perimeter of this sector, given that the radius of the circle is 12 units.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Find the Arc Length:** 

The arc length of the sector can be found using the formula:
\[ \text{Arc length} = \frac{\text{Central angle}}{360°} \times \text{Circumference of the circle} \]

Given:
Central angle = 60°
Radius, \( r \) = 12 units

First, we'll find the circumference of the circle:
\[ \text{Circumference} = 2\pi r = 2\pi \times 12 = 24\pi \]

Now, calculate the arc length:
\[ \text{Arc length} = \frac{60°}{360°} \times 24\pi = \frac{1}{6} \times 24\pi = 4\pi \]

2. **Determine the Perimeter of the Sector:**

The perimeter of the sector includes both the arc length and the two radii:

\[ \text{Perimeter of the sector} = \text{Arc length} + 2 \times \text{Radius} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter of the sector} = 4\pi + 2 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter of the sector} = 4\pi + 24 \]

Thus, the perimeter of the sector is \( 4\pi + 24 \) units.

Alright, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the vertices of the triangle.
- We know one vertex is \( (4,0) \) (as given in the problem).
- The line \( x = -2 \) intersects the line \( y = -2x + 8 \) at a certain point which will be another vertex.
- The line \( x = -2 \) also intersects the line \( y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 \) at another point which will be the third vertex.

Step 2: Find the other two vertices.
For the line \( y = -2x + 8 \) at \( x = -2 \):
\[ y = -2(-2) + 8 = 12 \]
So, one vertex is \( (-2,12) \).

For the line \( y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 \) at \( x = -2 \):
\[ y = \frac{1}{2}(-2) - 2 = -3 \]
So, the third vertex is \( (-2,-3) \).

Step 3: Compute the base and height of the triangle.
Using the two points that lie on the line \( x = -2 \) as the endpoints of the base, we find:
Base = Vertical distance between \( (-2,12) \) and \( (-2,-3) \)
Base = 12 - (-3) = 15 units.

The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from \( x = -2 \) to \( x = 4 \) (using the point \( (4,0) \) as the top vertex).
Height = 4 - (-2) = 6 units.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the triangle.
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times 6 = 45 \text{ square units} \]

2. **Ratio of Sides**:
   Given \( BD = 4BC \), and since \( BD \) and \( BC \) are sides of the similar triangles, we can determine the ratio of the sides of the two triangles. Since \( BD \) is part of \( \triangle CDE \) and \( BC \) is part of \( \triangle ABC \), the ratio of the sides is 4:1.

To determine the ratio of the smallest area to the largest area, we need to identify these regions and then compute their areas.

**Step 1:** Identify the smallest and largest regions.

From the image, the smallest regions are the tiny triangles, such as the one with vertices at (0,0), (0.5,0), and (0.5,0.5). The largest regions are the trapezoids, such as the one with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0.5,0.5), and (0,1).

**Step 2:** Compute the areas of the smallest and largest regions.

*Smallest Region (Triangle):* 
The base of this triangle is half the base of the hexagon, which is 0.5 units. Its height is also 0.5 units. Using the formula for the area of a triangle, we have:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \text{ square units} \]

*Largest Region (Trapezoid):*
This trapezoid has a smaller base of 1 unit, a larger base of 1.5 units (since half of it is 0.5 units), and a height of 0.5 units. Using the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we get:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{smaller base} + \text{larger base}) \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + 1.5) \times 0.5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2.5 \times 0.5 = 0.625 \text{ square units} \]

**Step 3:** Compute the ratio of the smallest area to the largest area.
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.25}{0.625} = \frac{1}{2.5} = \frac{2}{5} \]

From this, we can solve for \( r \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = 2\pi \]
\[ r^2 = 4 \]
\[ r = 2 \]
So, the radius of the semicircle is 2 units.

2. **Relating the triangle and the circle**:
The semicircle is tangent to both sides \( AC \) and \( BC \) of the triangle. This means that the radius drawn to these tangents is perpendicular to them. Therefore, the height of the triangle, from the hypotenuse \( AB \) to the right angle vertex \( C \), is also \( r \) or 2 units.

3. **Finding the lengths of the triangle**:
Since triangle \( ABC \) is an isosceles right triangle, the two sides \( AC \) and \( BC \) are congruent. We know that the semicircle's diameter is equal to the hypotenuse of the triangle, which means \( AB = 2r = 4 \) units.

Now, we use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 \]
Since \( AC \) and \( BC \) are equal, let's let them both be \( x \).
\[ x^2 + x^2 = 4^2 \]
\[ 2x^2 = 16 \]
\[ x^2 = 8 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \]
So, the lengths of sides \( AC \) and \( BC \) are both \( 2\sqrt{2} \) units.

4. **Finding the area of triangle \( ABC \)**:
Area of a triangle is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
Using \( AC \) as the base:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2\sqrt{2} \times 2\sqrt{2} \]
\[ \text{Area} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]
So, the area of triangle \( ABC \) is \( 8 \) square units.

\[ \pi r^2 h = 72\pi \]
Now, since the cone is inscribed inside the cylinder, the height of the cone is equal to the height of the cylinder and the base radius of the cone is equal to the radius of the cylinder. Let's use \( r \) for the radius and \( h \) for the height of both the cylinder and the cone.

**Step 2:** Determine the volume of the inscribed cone.

The formula for the volume of a cone is \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). Using this, the volume of the inscribed cone will be:
\[ V_{cone} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

**Step 3:** Find the space inside the cylinder but outside the cone.

This will be the volume of the cylinder minus the volume of the cone:
\[ V_{space} = V_{cylinder} - V_{cone} \]
\[ V_{space} = \pi r^2 h - \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]
\[ V_{space} = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

Given that \( \pi r^2 h = 72\pi \) (from step 1), replacing this in our equation we get:
\[ V_{space} = \frac{2}{3} \times 72\pi \]
\[ V_{space} = 48\pi \]

Thus, triangle \(ACX\) is also isosceles.

2. **Determine the base angles of the isosceles triangle \(ABC\).**
In any isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Thus, the measure of angle \(BAC\) (or \(\angle A\)) is equal to the measure of angle \(ABC\). We know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is \(180^\circ\). So, using that fact:

\[ \angle ABC + \angle ACB + 30^\circ = 180^\circ \]

Given that \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB\) (because triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles), we can say:
\[ 2(\angle ABC) + 30^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2(\angle ABC) = 150^\circ \]
\[ \angle ABC = 75^\circ \]

Thus, \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 75^\circ\).

3. **Determine the base angles of the isosceles triangle \(ACX\).**
Triangle \(ACX\) is also isosceles, with \(AC = CX\). Thus, the angles opposite these sides are equal, meaning \(\angle CAX = \angle ACX\).

We already know that \(\angle ACB = 75^\circ\). This means that:
\[ \angle CAX = 180^\circ - 75^\circ = 105^\circ \]
Thus, \(\angle ACX = 105^\circ\).

4. **Determine the measure of angle \(AXC\).**
Again, knowing the sum of the angles in triangle \(ACX\) is \(180^\circ\), we can say:

\[ \angle AXC + 105^\circ + 105^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle AXC = 180^\circ - 210^\circ = -30^\circ \]

However, angles can't be negative. This means that there's an error in the drawing or the problem's description, as the angles given are not consistent with the structure of an isosceles triangle.

In conclusion, based on the given information, the measure of angle \(AXC\) cannot be determined consistently.

Similarly,

Area of $\triangle STW$ = Area of $\triangle WUT$ = $\frac{1}{2} \times 1$ = $\frac{1}{2}$

Thus, the combined area of both smaller squares is $2(1) = 2$.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the triangular sections
The two right triangles formed by the sides of the larger square and the diagonal of the smaller squares are congruent. Let's find the area of one of these triangles and multiply by 2.

For triangle $ABY$:
Height = $AY - AB = 5 - 1 = 4$
Base = $AB = 1$
\[ Area_{triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 1 = 2 \]
Thus, the combined area of both triangles $ABY$ and $EFH$ is $2(2) = 4$.

The area of quadrilateral $DYES$ can be found by subtracting the areas of the two smaller squares and the two triangles from the area of the larger square.
\[ Area_{DYES} = Area_{ASHY} - 2 \times Area_{small squares} - 2 \times Area_{triangle} \]

Triangle \(OBC\) is a right triangle because \(O\) is the center of the circumcircle and angle \(BCA\) subtends the diameter of the circle. Using the properties of the circle, any angle that subtends the diameter is a right angle.

The base \(BC\) is 6 and the height (or altitude) is the radius of the circle, which is 2.

The area of triangle \(OBC\) is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 2 = 6\]

Thus, the area of triangle \(OBC\) is \(6 \text{ square units}\).

Given that ∠A = ∠B in triangle ABC, the triangle is an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, the sides opposite the equal angles are also equal.

So, side AB is equal to side AC.

From the information provided:

AB = x + 4
AC = 2x + 2

Since AB = AC, we have:

x + 4 = 2x + 2

Now, let's solve for x:

1. Subtracting x from both sides:
    4 = x + 2

2. Subtracting 2 from both sides:

Alright, let's solve this step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem setup
We have four small circles each of radius 1, and they're tangent to two sides of a square. There's also a larger circle with a radius of 2 that's tangent to the smaller circles.

Step 2: Determine the side length of the square
To determine the side length of the square, let's look at one corner of the square. The length from the corner of the square to where the small circle is tangent to the square's side is 1 (the radius of the small circle). The length from this tangent point to where the small circle is tangent to the large circle is also 1 (again, the radius of the small circle). Therefore, the distance from the corner of the square to the point where the large circle is tangent to the square is 2.

Now, considering the diameter of the large circle, which is 4, and adding the 2 units from one corner and another 2 units from the opposite corner, we can find that the side length of the square is:

2 + 4 + 2 = 8

Step 3: Calculate the area of the square
Now that we know the side length, we can determine the area. The area of a square is side length squared:

Area = 8^2 = 64

So, the area of the square is \(64\) square units.

Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1:** Understand the problem and draw the hexagon and triangles
You've provided a drawing, which makes things easier. We have a regular hexagon, which means all of its sides and angles are equal. Two equilateral triangles are formed by joining alternate vertices.

**Step 2:** Find the area of one equilateral triangle
The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times \text{side}^2 \]

Using the given side length of 4 inches:
\[ \text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 4^2 = 4\sqrt{3} \] square inches.

**Step 3:** Identify the common region
The common region between the two triangles is a smaller equilateral triangle (in the center of the hexagon) plus three congruent triangles on its sides.

**Step 4:** Find the side length of the smaller equilateral triangle
Since the hexagon is regular and each exterior angle of a regular hexagon is 60°, the smaller triangle is equilateral. Also, it's composed of two 30-60-90 triangles.

Using the properties of 30-60-90 triangles:
- The shortest side (half the side of the hexagon) is half the hypotenuse (which is a side of the hexagon). 
- The shortest side = \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) inches.
- The longer leg (height of the small triangle) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the shortest side, which is \( 2\sqrt{3} \) inches.

Thus, the height of the small equilateral triangle = \( 2 + 2\sqrt{3} \).

**Step 5:** Calculate the area of the smaller equilateral triangle
Using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times \text{side}^2 \]
\[ \text{Area of smaller triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (2 + 2\sqrt{3})^2 \]
\[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (4 + 8\sqrt{3} + 12) \]
\[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 16 \]
\[ = 4\sqrt{3} \] square inches.

**Step 6:** Find the area of one of the three congruent triangles
Each of these is a right triangle with legs of 2 inches and \( 2\sqrt{3} \) inches. 
\[ \text{Area of one right triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2\sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3} \] square inches.

Thus, the combined area of the three congruent triangles is \( 6\sqrt{3} \) square inches.

**Step 7:** Calculate the area of the common region
\[ \text{Area of common region} = \text{Area of smaller equilateral triangle} + \text{Area of the three congruent triangles} \]
\[ = 4\sqrt{3} + 6\sqrt{3} = 10\sqrt{3} \] square inches.

So, the area of the region that is common to the two triangles is \( \boxed{10\sqrt{3}} \) square inches.

Certainly! Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
Latitude lines are circles parallel to the equator. As we move from the equator to the poles, the circumference of these circles decreases. The equator itself is a latitude line at \(0^{\circ}\) and has the maximum circumference. Lena, Wisconsin, being at \(45^{\circ}\) North Latitude, is halfway between the equator and the North Pole. Thus, the circle through Lena will have a smaller circumference than the equator.

### Step 2: Use the Geometry of a Circle
If we think of Earth as a sphere (as the problem states), and if we slice the Earth horizontally through Lena, the resulting circle would have a radius that is the cosine of the latitude multiplied by the radius of the Earth.

Why is this? Because the latitude angle is measured from the center of the Earth. At \(0^{\circ}\) (the equator), the radius of the circle is equal to the radius of the Earth, but as the angle increases, the radius of the circle (representing the latitude line) decreases.

### Step 3: Calculate the Radius of the Circle Through Lena
Given the Earth's radius \( R \) (which can be calculated from its circumference), the radius \( r \) of the circle through Lena is:
\[ r = R \times \cos(45^{\circ}) \]

We can calculate \( R \) from the given circumference of the Earth:
Circumference of the Earth = \( 2\pi R \)
\[ 25,100 = 2\pi R \]
\[ R = \frac{25,100}{2\pi} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Circumference of the Circle Through Lena
Using the formula for the circumference:
\[ C = 2\pi r \]
\[ C = 2\pi (R \times \cos(45^{\circ})) \]

### Now, let's compute the answer:

From step 3:
\[ R = \frac{25,100}{2\pi} \approx 7,981.75 \] miles (rounded to two decimal places)

Using this in step 4:
\[ C = 2\pi (7,981.75 \times \cos(45^{\circ})) \]

\[ C \approx 2\pi (7,981.75 \times 0.7071) \]
\[ C \approx 2\pi (5,650.22) \]
\[ C \approx 35,484.06 \]

To the nearest hundred miles, the circumference is approximately \( 35,500 \) miles.

So, the number of miles in the circumference of the circle on Earth parallel to the equator and through Lena, Wisconsin, is approximately \( 35,500 \) miles.

To determine the perimeter of the trapezoid, we need to find the lengths of all of its sides. We already know the lengths of two of its sides (12 cm and 16 cm). We need to find the lengths of the slanting sides.

Let's denote the unknown base of the trapezoid as \( b \) cm. The area of a trapezoid is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{height} \times (\text{base}_1 + \text{base}_2) \]

Given:
Height = 12 cm
Base 1 = 16 cm
Area = 162 cm^2

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ 162 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times (16 + b) \]

Simplifying:

\[ 324 = 12 \times (16 + b) \]
\[ 324 = 192 + 12b \]
\[ 132 = 12b \]
\[ b = 11 \]

So, the unknown base of the trapezoid is 11 cm.

Now, let's determine the lengths of the two slanting sides of the trapezoid.

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle formed by the height, one of the slanting sides, and the difference between the two bases, we get:

For one side:
\[ \text{Side}^2 = 12^2 + \left(\frac{16-11}{2}\right)^2 \]
\[ \text{Side}^2 = 144 + 2.5^2 \]
\[ \text{Side}^2 = 144 + 6.25 \]
\[ \text{Side}^2 = 150.25 \]
\[ \text{Side} = \sqrt{150.25} \]
\[ \text{Side} = 12.25 \text{ cm} \]

Both the slanting sides will have the same length, so both are 12.25 cm.

Now, adding all the sides to get the perimeter:

Perimeter = 12 + 16 + 11 + 12.25 + 12.25
= 63.5 cm

So, the perimeter of the trapezoid is \( 63.5 \text{ cm} \).

Alright, let's solve this step by step:

**Step 1: Understand the relation between the inscribed square and the triangle**

For triangle \( ABC \), the hypotenuse \( AC \) is divided into two segments by the inscribed square's vertex: one segment is equal to the side length of the square (let's call this \( s \)) and the other segment is equal to the diagonal of the square.

Now, since \( ABC \) is an isosceles right triangle, the diagonal of the square will be \( s \times \sqrt{2} \).

**Step 2: Setting up the equation**

We're given that the area of the inscribed square in triangle \( ABC \) is 15 square centimeters. So, \( s^2 = 15 \) and \( s = \sqrt{15} \).

Now, for triangle \( ABC \):

Length of segment equal to side of square = \( s = \sqrt{15} \)

Length of segment equal to diagonal of square = \( s \times \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{15} \times \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{30} \)

Since \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the isosceles right triangle, it is equal to \( s + \sqrt{30} \).

**Step 3: Find the hypotenuse of triangle \( DEF \)**

Triangle \( DEF \) is congruent to triangle \( ABC \), so the hypotenuse \( DF \) is also \( \sqrt{15} + \sqrt{30} \).

**Step 4: Find the side of the inscribed square in triangle \( DEF \)**

For triangle \( DEF \), let's denote the side of the inscribed square as \( t \). 

Similarly, as we deduced for triangle \( ABC \), the hypotenuse \( DF \) is divided into two segments: one of length \( t \) (the side of the square) and the other of length \( t \times \sqrt{2} \) (the diagonal of the square).

So, \( DF = t + t\sqrt{2} \)

Given, \( DF = \sqrt{15} + \sqrt{30} \)

Equating the two expressions, we get:

\( t(1 + \sqrt{2}) = \sqrt{15} + \sqrt{30} \)

**Step 5: Solve for \( t \)**

To find \( t \), divide both sides by \( (1 + \sqrt{2}) \):

\[ t = \frac{\sqrt{15} + \sqrt{30}}{1 + \sqrt{2}} \]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \( (1 - \sqrt{2}) \):

\[ t = \frac{(\sqrt{15} + \sqrt{30})(1 - \sqrt{2})}{(1 + \sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2})} \]

\[ t = \frac{\sqrt{15} - 15 + \sqrt{30} - \sqrt{60}}{-1} \]

Since \( \sqrt{60} = \sqrt{4 \times 15} = 2\sqrt{15} \), the equation becomes:

\[ t = \frac{-\sqrt{15} + \sqrt{30} + 2\sqrt{15}}{-1} \]
\[ t = \sqrt{30} - \sqrt{15} \]

**Step 6: Find the area of the inscribed square in triangle \( DEF \)**

Area = \( t^2 \)

\[ = (\sqrt{30} - \sqrt{15})^2 \]
\[ = 30 - 2(\sqrt{30}\sqrt{15}) + 15 \]
\[ = 45 - 2\sqrt{450} \]
\[ = 45 - 2(15\sqrt{2}) \]
\[ = 45 - 30\sqrt{2} \]

So, the area of the square inscribed in triangle \( DEF \) is \( 45 - 30\sqrt{2} \) square centimeters.

Given the information, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to deduce certain things about the triangle and the lengths involved. Here's a step-by-step reasoning:

**Step 1: Determine the height of the balloon.**

Given that HC has a length of 150 m and HD has a length of 130 m, and both C and D are on a straight line with distance 140 m apart, we can determine the height of the balloon (let's call it HO) using the Pythagorean theorem:

For triangle HOC:
\[ HC^2 = HO^2 + OC^2 \]

\[ 150^2 = HO^2 + 70^2 \] (since OC is half the distance of CD)
\[ 22500 = HO^2 + 4900 \]
\[ HO^2 = 17600 \]
\[ HO = 132.67 \] (approximating to 2 decimal places)

For triangle HOD (this is just for verification):
\[ HD^2 = HO^2 + OD^2 \]
\[ 130^2 = HO^2 + 70^2 \]
\[ 16900 = HO^2 + 4900 \]
\[ HO^2 = 12000 \]
\[ HO = 109.55 \] 

This discrepancy is due to the fact that the balloon isn't at the same height above both points C and D. For our purposes, we'll need both heights.

**Step 2: Determine the length of rope HP.**

Let x be the distance from point D to point P. Thus, the distance from point P to point C will be 140 - x.

For triangle HOP:
\[ HP^2 = HO^2 + OP^2 \]
\[ OP = x \]
\[ HP^2 = 12000 + x^2 \] (using the height for point D)

For triangle HOP when OP is 140 - x (i.e., closer to C):
\[ HP^2 = 17600 + (140 - x)^2 \] (using the height for point C)

**Step 3: Determine where HP is minimized.**

By setting the two equations for HP^2 equal to each other and solving for x, we'll determine the point on CD where the rope length is minimized:

\[ 12000 + x^2 = 17600 + (140 - x)^2 \]

Expanding and combining like terms:
\[ 12000 + x^2 = 17600 + 19600 - 280x + x^2 \]
\[ -5600 = -280x \]
\[ x = 20 \]

Thus, P is 20 meters from D and 120 meters from C.

**Step 4: Determine the amount of rope saved.**

Using the Pythagorean theorem again, find the minimized length of HP when x = 20:
\[ HP^2 = 12000 + 20^2 \]
\[ HP^2 = 12000 + 400 \]
\[ HP^2 = 12400 \]
\[ HP = 111.36 \] (approximating to 2 decimal places)

Now, to find the amount of rope saved:
\[ (150 + 130) - 111.36 = 168.64 \]

Therefore, the greatest length of rope that can be saved is approximately \( \boxed{168.64} \) meters.

6. **Using the Area Formula**:
   Since triangle \( AXB \) is half the area of triangle \( XCY \), we can express the area of triangle \( AXB \) in terms of the area of triangle \( XCY \) and vice versa.

   \( \text{Area} (AXY) = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Area} (XCY) \).

   But \( \text{Area} (XCY) \) is half the area of the whole triangle \( XYZ \).

2. **Triangles BDA and BDC are Congruent:** Since \(AC = BC\), triangle \(ABC\) is an isosceles triangle. As a result, the altitude \(BD\) will bisect side \(AC\) into two congruent segments. This means that \(AD = DC\). 

Additionally, by definition of an altitude, \(\angle ABD\) and \(\angle CBD\) are right angles. So, triangles \(BDA\) and \(BDC\) are congruent by the hypotenuse-leg congruency theorem (they share hypotenuse \(BC\) and have a congruent leg each: \(AD = DC\)).

3. **Calculate \(\angle ABD\) and \(\angle CBD\):** From the given information, we know that \(\angle OAC = 18^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle CAD = 90^\circ - 18^\circ = 72^\circ\). 

Since triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles and \(AD = DC\), the angles \(\angle ABD\) and \(\angle CBD\) are congruent and their measures are half of \(\angle CAD\). So, \(\angle ABD = \angle CBD = \frac{72^\circ}{2} = 36^\circ\).

4. **Calculate \(\angle ABO\):** Since \(\angle ABD = 36^\circ\) and \(\angle ABD\) and \(\angle ABO\) are supplementary (because they are on the same line segment and add up to 180º), \(\angle ABO = 180^\circ - 36^\circ = 144^\circ\).

5. **Use Arcs to Calculate \(\angle AOB\):** In a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle (like \(\angle ABO\)) is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. So, \(\angle AOB\) is twice the measure of \(\angle ABO\). Thus, \(\angle AOB = 2 \times 144^\circ = 288^\circ\).

However, we have a problem here. An angle cannot be 288º in this context. We made an error in the reasoning. Let's correct it:

Actually, \(\angle AOB\) intercepts arc \(AC\), while \(\angle ABO\) intercepts the arc's remainder. If the arc \(AC\) is represented by \(x\), then the arc intercepted by \(\angle ABO\) is \(360^\circ - x\). Given that the measure of an inscribed angle is half of its intercepted arc, we have:
\[ \angle ABO = \frac{1}{2} \times (360^\circ - x) = 144^\circ \]
\[ 360^\circ - x = 288^\circ \]
\[ x = 72^\circ \]

Thus, the arc \(AC\) is 72º, and \(\angle AOB = \frac{1}{2} \times 72^\circ = 36^\circ\).

So, \(\angle AOB = 36^\circ\).

To determine the length of arc \( \widehat{AB} \), we'll use the relationship between the measure of a central angle and the length of its intercepted arc in a circle. First, let's find the measure of the central angle.

Given:
1. \( AB \| CD \) and \( AD \) is a diameter.

Since \( AD \) is a diameter, \( \angle ACD \) is a right angle (because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle).

Because \( AB \| CD \), then \( \angle ABC \) is also a right angle (alternate interior angles are congruent when lines are parallel).

Thus, \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

Given that \( \angle ADB = 50^\circ \), we can find \( \angle ABD \) using the fact that the angles in a triangle sum up to \( 180^\circ \).

Therefore, \( \angle ABD = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 50^\circ = 40^\circ \).

Since \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle ABD \) intercept the same arc \( \widehat{AB} \), they are equal. This gives \( \angle ABD = 40^\circ \) as the central angle that intercepts arc \( \widehat{AB} \).

Now, the ratio of the central angle to \( 360^\circ \) is the same as the ratio of the length of the intercepted arc to the circumference of the circle.

Using the formula for the circumference of a circle, \( C = \pi d \), where \( d \) is the diameter:

\[ C = \pi \times 36^{\prime \prime} = 36\pi^{\prime \prime} \]

So, the length of arc \( \widehat{AB} \) is:

\[ \left( \frac{40^\circ}{360^\circ} \right) \times 36\pi^{\prime \prime} = \frac{1}{9} \times 36\pi^{\prime \prime} = 4\pi^{\prime \prime} \]

Therefore, the number of inches in the length of \( \widehat{AB} \) is \( 4\pi^{\prime \prime} \).

1. **Finding the Radius of the Large Circle:**
   The diameter of the large circle is the sum of the diameters of three small circles in a row (since 3 small circles can fit perfectly across the diameter of the large circle). Given that each small circle has a radius of 1, its diameter will be 2. So, the diameter of the large circle is \(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\). This makes the radius of the large circle \(6/2 = 3\).

2. **Area of the Large Circle:**
   The formula for the area of a circle is \(πr^2\). Using the radius we found:

   The shaded area is the difference between the area of the large circle and the combined area of the seven small circles:
   \(Shaded Area = Area_{large} - Area_{small}\)

2. The measure of an inscribed angle in a circle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since \( \angle A \) intercepts arc \( BC \), the measure of arc \( BC \) is \( 2 \times 68^\circ = 136^\circ \).

3. \( \angle OBC \) and \( \angle OCB \) are both inscribed angles that intercept the same arc \( AC \). Thus, they are congruent. Let's call each of these angles \( x \).

4. The three angles in triangle \( OBC \) are \( \angle OCB \), \( \angle OBC \), and \( \angle BOC \). Their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \). Since \( \angle BOC \) subtends a semicircle, \( \angle BOC = 180^\circ - 136^\circ = 44^\circ \).

### Step 1: Find the coordinates of point D.
Given that rectangle $ABDE$ has one side (AE) parallel to the x-axis and point A is $(1,1)$ while E is $(4,1)$, it means the length AE = 3 units (since the y-coordinate remains the same). Given that the rectangle has all right angles and sides opposite to each other are equal, the height of the rectangle (distance from A to B or D to E) will be the same as the y-coordinate of point C minus the y-coordinate of point A, which is $3 - 1 = 2$ units. 

So, point D would be $(4, 3)$, since it's the same vertical distance above E as B is above A.

### Step 2: Calculate the area of triangle $ACE$.
The base of the triangle is $AE$ and its length is 3 units. The height of the triangle is the distance from C to the line AE which is the difference in their y-coordinates: $3 - 1 = 2$ units.

\[ \text{Area of triangle } ACE = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Area of triangle } ACE = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Area of triangle } ACE = 3 \text{ square units} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the area of rectangle $ABDE$.
The length of the rectangle is the distance between A and E, which is 3 units. The width of the rectangle is the distance between A and B or D and E, which is 2 units.

\[ \text{Area of rectangle } ABDE = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{Area of rectangle } ABDE = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Area of rectangle } ABDE = 6 \text{ square units} \]

### Step 4: Find the ratio of the area of triangle $ACE$ to the area of rectangle $ABDE$.
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Area of triangle } ACE}{\text{Area of rectangle } ABDE} \]
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{3}{6} \]

Alright! Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the radii of the semicircles.
We are told that the diameter of the largest semicircle is 16 cm. Therefore, its radius is 16/2 = 8 cm.

Step 2: Calculate the area of the largest semicircle.
The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[ \text{Area} = \pi r^2 \]
For a semicircle, it will be half of this:
\[ \text{Area of semicircle} = \frac{\pi r^2}{2} \]
Using 3.14 as an approximation for π:
\[ \text{Area of largest semicircle} = \frac{3.14 \times 8^2}{2} = \frac{3.14 \times 64}{2} = 3.14 \times 32 = 100.48 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Step 3: Identify the radii of the smaller semicircles.
Each smaller semicircle is formed by dividing the larger semicircle's diameter into half, which gives 8 cm as the diameter of each smaller semicircle. Therefore, the radius of each smaller semicircle is 8/2 = 4 cm.

Step 4: Calculate the area of one of the smaller semicircles.
\[ \text{Area of smaller semicircle} = \frac{3.14 \times 4^2}{2} = \frac{3.14 \times 16}{2} = 3.14 \times 8 = 25.12 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Step 5: Calculate the combined area of the two smaller semicircles.
\[ \text{Combined area} = 2 \times 25.12 = 50.24 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Step 6: Find the shaded area.
The two shaded regions combined are equivalent to the area of the largest semicircle minus the combined area of the two smaller semicircles.
\[ \text{Shaded area} = 100.48 - 50.24 = 50.24 \text{ cm}^2 \]

So, the total number of square cm in the area of the two shaded regions is \( 50.24 \text{ cm}^2 \) rounded to the nearest tenth.

For a decagon, \( n = 10 \):

Since all angles in a regular decagon are equal, the measure of one angle is:
\[ \text{One angle} = \frac{1440^\circ}{10} = 144^\circ \]

The diagonal divides the decagon into an octagon and a quadrilateral. 

The angle opposite the diagonal in the quadrilateral will be \( x \). The other angle of the quadrilateral adjacent to \( x \) is one of the interior angles of the decagon, which we've determined to be \( 144^\circ \).

Now, in the quadrilateral, the sum of interior angles is \( 360^\circ \). With two angles being from the decagon (each \( 144^\circ \)), and the third angle being \( x \), we can set up the following equation to solve for \( x \):

\[ 144^\circ + 144^\circ + x + x = 360^\circ \]

Thus, each of these triangles has angles of \( 45^\circ \), \( 135^\circ \), and \( 45^\circ \).

Let's focus on triangle \( AHD \), one of the 8 isosceles triangles formed by drawing all the diagonals from a vertex of the octagon. The side \( AD \) is the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 triangle. The ratio of the sides in a 45-45-90 triangle is \( 1:1:\sqrt{2} \). Therefore, the length of \( AD \) is:
\[ AD = AH \times \sqrt{2} \]
\[ AD = 12\sqrt{2} \text{ cm} \]

Using triangle \( AHD \), we can determine the height of trapezoid \( BCDE \). 
We can split triangle \( AHD \) into two right triangles by drawing altitude \( HI \) to base \( AD \). \( HI \) is also an altitude to the trapezoid \( BCDE \).

Since \( AHI \) is a 45-45-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides remains \( 1:1:\sqrt{2} \). Thus, the altitude \( HI \) (or the height of the trapezoid) is half of the diagonal \( AD \):
\[ HI = \frac{AD}{2} \]
\[ HI = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ HI = 6\sqrt{2} \text{ cm} \]

**Step 2:** Calculate the perimeter of the equilateral triangle.

Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal:

\[ \text{Perimeter of triangle} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ cm} \]

**Step 3:** Determine the side length of the square.

Given that the square and the equilateral triangle have equal perimeters, the perimeter of the square is also 24 cm. 

Since the square has four equal sides, each side is:

\[ \text{Side length of square} = \frac{\text{Perimeter of square}}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ cm} \]

**Step 4:** Calculate the diagonal of the square.

The diagonal of a square divides the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the length of the hypotenuse (or the diagonal of the square) is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of one of the legs (or the side of the square).

\[ \text{Diagonal} = 6 \times \sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2} \text{ cm} \]

So, the length of the diagonal of the square is \(6\sqrt{2}\) cm.

Alright, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, notice that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle since AD = BD and BD = CD. Therefore, $\angle ABC = \angle BCA = 40^\circ$.

2. In triangle ABD, since AD = BD, this triangle is also isosceles. Therefore, $\angle BAD = \angle ABD$. Let's call the measure of this angle x.

3. In triangle ADC, since AD = CD, this triangle is also isosceles. Therefore, $\angle CAD = \angle ACD$. Let's also call the measure of this angle y.

4. The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$. Using this information for triangle ABD:
   $$\angle BAD + \angle ABD + \angle ADB = 180^\circ$$
   Using our above definitions:
   $$x + x + 40^\circ = 180^\circ$$
   $$2x = 140^\circ$$
   $$x = 70^\circ$$

5. Similarly, for triangle ADC:
   $$\angle CAD + \angle ACD + \angle ADC = 180^\circ$$
   Using our definitions:
   $$y + y + 40^\circ = 180^\circ$$
   $$2y = 140^\circ$$
   $$y = 70^\circ$$

6. Now, $\angle BAC$ can be found by adding $\angle BAD$ and $\angle CAD$:
   $$\angle BAC = x + y = 70^\circ + 70^\circ = 140^\circ$$

So, the measure of $\angle BAC$ is $140^\circ$.

Since ABC is an equilateral triangle with side length 12:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 12^2 = 144\sqrt{3} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Area of Triangle QPC

Using the height-to-base ratio of similar triangles:

Since $AQ = 8$, $QC = 12 - 8 = 4$. Therefore, the ratio of the height of triangle QPC to that of triangle ABC is $4/12 = 1/3$.

\[ \text{Area of } \triangle QPC = \frac{1}{3} \times 144\sqrt{3} = 48\sqrt{3} \]

### Step 3: Determine the Distance MP

Using the Pythagorean theorem on the triangle DMP, with the given DM = 4 and DP being half the height of triangle ABC:

Let $h$ be the height of triangle ABC. Then, $DP = \frac{1}{2}h$.

\[ h^2 + (12/2)^2 = 12^2 \]
\[ h^2 = 12^2 - 6^2 \]
\[ h^2 = 72 \]

Now, for triangle DMP, using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ MP^2 = DM^2 + DP^2 \]
\[ MP^2 = 4^2 + (3\sqrt{2})^2 \]
\[ MP^2 = 16 + 18 \]
\[ MP^2 = 34 \]
\[ MP = \sqrt{34} \]

### Step 4: Find the Volume of the Solid QPCDMN

The solid QPCDMN is a triangular prism with base QPC and height MP.

\[ \text{Volume of QPCDMN} = \text{Area of } \triangle QPC \times MP \]
\[ \text{Volume of QPCDMN} = 48\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{34} \]
\[ \text{Volume of QPCDMN} = 48\sqrt{102} \]
\[ \text{Volume of QPCDMN} = 48 \times 6\sqrt{3} \]
\[ \text{Volume of QPCDMN} = 288\sqrt{3} \]

**Step 3:** The shaded region is a sector of the circle. The area of a sector with an angle \( x \) in a circle with radius \( r \) is given by \( \frac{x}{360} \times \pi r^2 \). In this case, this is the area of the shaded region.

**Step 4:** Setting the area of the sector equal to the given area of the shaded region, we have:

\[ \text{arc } RS = 2 \times 74^\circ = 148^\circ \]

2. Next, angle \( RTB \) is an angle formed by a tangent and a chord. The measure of this angle is half the difference between the intercepted arcs. In this case, the intercepted arcs are \( RS \) and \( RB \). Let's denote the measure of arc \( RB \) as \( x \).

   - Radius of AB = \( r \)
   - Radius of BC = \( 2r \) (since BC is twice the length of AB)
   - Radius of CD = \( 3r \) (since CD is three times the length of AB)

To determine the area of the shaded region, we'll start by finding the area of the larger sector (the one that includes the shaded region) and then subtracting the area of the smaller sector that's cut out.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Finding the radius of the larger sector:**
   The smallest circle has a radius of 2 feet. There are four circles shown (including the center one), so the largest circle (or the fourth one) has a radius of:
   \(2 + 3(2) = 8\) feet.

2. **Finding the area of the larger sector:**
   The sector is 1/12 of the whole circle because there are 12 congruent central angles that make up the full circle.
   The area of a full circle with a radius of 8 feet is:
   \(A = \pi r^2 = \pi(8^2) = 64\pi\).
   So, the area of the larger sector is:
   \(1/12 \times 64\pi = 64\pi/12 = 32\pi/6 = 16\pi/3\).

3. **Finding the radius of the smaller sector:**
   The third circle has a radius of:
   \(2 + 2(2) = 6\) feet.

4. **Finding the area of the smaller sector:**
   The area of a full circle with a radius of 6 feet is:
   \(A = \pi r^2 = \pi(6^2) = 36\pi\).
   So, the area of the smaller sector is:
   \(1/12 \times 36\pi = 36\pi/12 = 3\pi\).

5. **Finding the area of the shaded region:**
   Subtract the area of the smaller sector from the area of the larger sector:
   \(16\pi/3 - 3\pi = 16\pi/3 - 9\pi/3 = 7\pi/3\).

Certainly! Let's use properties of similar triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem to solve this problem.

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Establish a Center:** Draw the center of the circle, which we'll call \(O\). Let the shorter chord be \(AB\) with a midpoint \(M\), and the longer chord be \(CD\) with a midpoint \(N\). Draw the radius \(OA\) and \(OC\). 

2. **Midpoints of Chords:** Recall that a radius perpendicular to a chord bisects that chord. Thus, \(OA\) and \(OC\) are perpendicular to \(AB\) and \(CD\) respectively. This means \(AM = 5\), \(MB = 5\), \(CN = 7\), and \(ND = 7\).

3. **Find Distance from Center to Midpoint of Chord:** The distance from \(O\) to \(M\) will be \(OM\) and from \(O\) to \(N\) will be \(ON\). Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[OM^2 = OA^2 - AM^2 = OA^2 - 25\]
\[ON^2 = OC^2 - CN^2 = OC^2 - 49\]

Note that \(OA = OC\) because they are both radii of the same circle.

4. **Establish the Midway Chord:** Let's call the chord parallel to \(AB\) and \(CD\) and midway between them as \(EF\) with midpoint \(P\). Thus, \(OP\) is midway between \(OM\) and \(ON\), i.e., \(OP = \frac{OM + ON}{2}\).

Given that \(MN = 6\), we can determine the lengths \(MP\) and \(PN\) as each being half of \(MN\), which is 3. This means \(MP = PN = 3\).

5. **Using Pythagoras' Theorem for Midway Chord:** 
\[OP^2 = OM^2 - MP^2\]
\[OP^2 = ON^2 - PN^2\]

From these two equations, we can conclude that:
\[OM^2 - 9 = ON^2 - 9\]
\[OM^2 = ON^2\]

This confirms our earlier result that \(OM\) and \(ON\) are the same length.

6. **Find \(EP\):** We have:
\[EP^2 = OP^2 - PE^2\]

Where \(PE\) is half the length of chord \(EF\), which we want to find.

Since \(OM = ON\), and \(OP\) is the average of \(OM\) and \(ON\), \(OP = OM = ON\).

Thus, \(EP^2 = OM^2 - 9\).

7. **Solve for \(EF\):** 
\[EF = 2EP\]
\[EF^2 = 4(OM^2 - 9)\]
\[EF^2 = 4(OA^2 - 25 - 9)\]
\[EF^2 = 4(OA^2 - 34)\]
\[EF^2 = 4(OA^2 - 49 + 15)\]
\[EF^2 = 4((OC^2 - 49) + 15)\]
\[EF^2 = 4(ON^2 + 15)\]
\[EF^2 = 4(OM^2 + 15)\]
\[EF^2 = 4(OP^2 + 24)\]
\[EF^2 = 4(3^2 + 24)\]
\[EF^2 = 4(33)\]
\[EF^2 = 132\]

We can solve this problem using the Pythagorean theorem.

Given:

2. Square $ABCD$ has all sides equal, so $AB = BC = CD = DA = 5$.

We are asked to find $PD$.

**Step 1:** Find the length of $PC$.
Since $PAB$ is a right triangle with $PA$ as one leg, $PB$ as the hypotenuse, and $AB$ as the other leg:
\[AB^2 + PA^2 = PB^2\]
\[AB^2 = PB^2 - PA^2\]

Given:
\[PA = 3\]
\[PB = 4\]
\[AB = 5\]

Substitute the given values into the equation:
\[5^2 = 4^2 - 3^2\]
\[25 = 16 - 9\]
\[25 = 7\]

But 25 is not equal to 7. This suggests that the given information about triangle $PAB$ might be incorrect, as the sides do not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. Given the provided values, $PAB$ cannot be a right triangle. 

However, assuming the given information is correct and you might want the length of $PC$:
Using the Pythagoras theorem on triangle $PAB$:
\[AB^2 = PA^2 + PB^2\]
\[5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2\]
\[25 = 9 + 16\]
\[25 = 25\]

Now, since $ABCD$ is a square, $BC = AB = 5$.
Thus, $PC$ (which is the diagonal of the square) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[PC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\]
\[PC^2 = 5^2 + 5^2\]
\[PC^2 = 25 + 25\]
\[PC^2 = 50\]
\[PC = \sqrt{50}\]
\[PC = 5\sqrt{2}\]

**Step 2:** Find the length of $PD$.
$PD$ is the height dropped from point $P$ onto diagonal $CD$.

Triangle $PCD$ is a right triangle, with $PD$ as the height, $PC$ as the hypotenuse, and $CD$ as the base.

Using the properties of similar triangles, we can establish that:
\[\frac{PD}{PC} = \frac{CD}{2}{PC}\]

Substitute in the values we know:
\[\frac{PD}{5\sqrt{2}} = \frac{5/2}{5\sqrt{2}}\]

Cross-multiplying:
\[PD = \frac{5/2}{\sqrt{2}}\]
\[PD = \frac{5}{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\]
\[PD = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4}\]

Thus, the length of $PD$ is \(\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4}\).

Let's start with what we know:

Next, let's figure out the area of \(ABC\).

Given that \(AF = FG = GB\), and \(AF + FG + GB = AB\), each segment has a length of \(AB/3\).

Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(DC\), \(DE = EC = DC/2 = l/2\).

The area of triangle \(ABC\) is \(0.5 \times l \times AB = 0.5 \times l \times 3(AB/3) = 1.5 \times l \times (AB/3)\).

The area of triangle \(EFG\) is \(0.5 \times l/2 \times 2(AB/3) = 0.5 \times l/2 \times 2(AB/3) = l \times (AB/3)\).

Since \(H\) is the intersection of \(AC\) and \(EF\), and since \(AF = FG\), \(HF = HG\).

Triangle \(AHF\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) (because of AA similarity as they share angle at A and both have a right angle). The height of triangle \(AHF\) is \(HF = FG = AB/3\).

The area of triangle \(AHF\) is \(0.5 \times l \times AB/3\).

Now, \(EHJ\) is a triangle formed by subtracting \(AHF\) and \(EFG\) from \(ABC\).

Area \(EHJ\) = Area \(ABC\) - Area \(EFG\) - Area \(AHF\)

= \(1.5 \times l \times (AB/3) - l \times (AB/3) - 0.5 \times l \times AB/3\)

= \(0.5 \times l \times (AB/3)\).

Given \(l \times w = 70\), and using the fact that \(l \times (AB/3) = 70/3\), the area of \(EHJ\) is:

\(0.5 \times (70/3) = 35/3\).

Since the triangles are isosceles right triangles, their two legs are of equal length. Let's call this length \( x \). Since it's a right triangle, using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse will be \( x\sqrt{2} \).

Since the hypotenuse also corresponds to a side of the square, it is 10 inches.

Two triangle legs total: \( 2 \times 5\sqrt{2} = 10\sqrt{2} \)

One side of the octagon: \( 10 - 5\sqrt{2} \)

Using equation (2) \( s^2 = r^2 \), the equation becomes:

Expanding and rearranging:
\[ 9 + 5\sqrt{2} = 2r^2 - 2r(s\sqrt{2}) \]
\[ 9 + 5\sqrt{2} = 2r^2 - 2r^2\sqrt{2} \]

So \( r = \sqrt{7} \).

Using equation (2):
\[ s = r \]

\[ b = a - \frac{a}{2} = \frac{a}{2} \]

**Step 3: Use the relationship between areas**

The area of a rhombus is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

For similar polygons, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

Thus, the ratio of the areas of \( BFDE \) to \( ABCD \) is:
\[ \left( \frac{b}{a} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{a/2}{a} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the area of rhombus \( BFDE \)**

Given that the area of \( ABCD \) is 24, the area of \( BFDE \) is:
\[ \text{Area of } BFDE = \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6 \]

So, the area of rhombus \( BFDE \) is \( 6 \) square units.

The figure depicts a right triangle ABC with a smaller right triangle BDC inside of it. 

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem on Triangle ABC**:
\[AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2\]

We know:
\[AC = 13\]
So,
\[AB^2 + BC^2 = 13^2 = 169\]

2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem on Triangle BDC**:
\[BD^2 + DC^2 = BC^2\]

Given:
\[DC = 2\]
Thus, 
\[BD^2 + 2^2 = BD^2 + 4 = BC^2\]

3. **Substituting the expression for \( BC^2 \) from the larger triangle into that of the smaller triangle**:
\[BD^2 + 4 = 169 - AB^2\]
\[BD^2 = 165 - AB^2\]

4. **Considering the height of the triangles**:
Since triangles ABC and BDC are similar right triangles, the ratio of their heights will be the same as the ratio of their hypotenuses. 

Thus,
\[ \frac{BD}{AB} = \frac{DC}{AC} \]
\[ \frac{BD}{AB} = \frac{2}{13} \]
\[ BD = \frac{2}{13} \times AB \]

5. **Substitute the expression for BD into the equation derived in step 3**:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{13} \times AB \right)^2 = 165 - AB^2 \]
\[ \frac{4}{169} \times AB^2 = 165 - AB^2 \]
\[ \frac{4 + 169}{169} \times AB^2 = 165 \]
\[ \frac{173}{169} \times AB^2 = 165 \]

From which we get:
\[ AB^2 = \frac{165 \times 169}{173} \]
\[ AB^2 = 161.849 \] 
Taking the square root,
\[ AB = 12.72 \] (rounded to two decimal places)

6. **Calculate BD using the relation between AB and BD derived in step 4**:
\[ BD = \frac{2}{13} \times 12.72 = 1.96 \]

Thus, the length of segment \( BD \) is approximately \( \boxed{1.96} \) units.

To determine the area of the given convex pentagon, we can decompose it into triangles and calculate the area of each triangle.

Let's label the points as follows:
A = (-1, -1)
B = (-3, 4)
C = (1, 7)
D = (6, 5)
E = (3, -1)

We can break this pentagon into triangles in various ways. For simplicity, let's use point A as a reference and form the triangles ABC, ACD, and ADE.

To find the area of a triangle with coordinates (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3), we use the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |x1(y2-y3) + x2(y3-y1) + x3(y1-y2)| \]

**Triangle ABC**:
Using the formula and the coordinates for A, B, and C:
Area(ABC) = 0.5 * |-1(4-7) -3(7+1) +1(-1-4)|
            = 0.5 * |3 + 24 - 5|
            = 0.5 * 22
            = 11

**Triangle ACD**:
Using the formula and the coordinates for A, C, and D:
Area(ACD) = 0.5 * |-1(7-5) +1(5+1) +6(-1-7)|
            = 0.5 * |2 + 6 - 48|
            = 0.5 * -40
            = -20 (take the absolute value)
            = 20

**Triangle ADE**:
Using the formula and the coordinates for A, D, and E:
Area(ADE) = 0.5 * |-1(5+1) +6(-1+1) +3(-1-5)|
            = 0.5 * |-6 + 0 + 18|
            = 0.5 * 12
            = 6

Finally, summing up the areas of the triangles:
Total Area = Area(ABC) + Area(ACD) + Area(ADE)
          = 11 + 20 + 6
          = 37

So, the area of the pentagon is \(37 \text{ square units}\).

Let's solve the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Find the radius of the semi-circle with center \( K \).

To find the radius of the semi-circle with center \( K \), we first need to find the diameter \( AK \). This diameter is made up of the two radii of the other semi-circles. 

Given:
\( OC = 32 \) (This is also the diameter of the semi-circle with center \( O \), so the radius is \( OC/2 = 16 \))

\( CB = 36 \) (This is also the diameter of the semi-circle with center \( M \), so the radius is \( CB/2 = 18 \))

The diameter \( AK \) of the semi-circle with center \( K \) is the sum of the two radii from the other semi-circles:
\[ AK = 16 + 18 = 34 \]
So, the radius \( KO \) of the semi-circle with center \( K \) is half of \( AK \):
\[ KO = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

**Step 2:** Calculate the area of the semi-circle with center \( K \).

The area \( A \) of a circle with radius \( r \) is given by:
\[ A = \pi r^2 \]
So, the area of the semi-circle would be half of this:
\[ A_{semi-circle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \]

Using the radius \( KO = 17 \) we found:
\[ A_{semi-circle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (17^2) \]
\[ A_{semi-circle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (289) \]
\[ A_{semi-circle} = 144.5 \pi \]

Thus, the area of the semi-circle with center \( K \) is \( 144.5 \pi \) square units.

Alright, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identifying the right triangles:**
   The line segment BX is perpendicular to AC, so we have two right triangles: 
   - ΔABX and 
   - ΔBCX.

2. **Using the properties of a rectangle:**
   Since ABCD is a rectangle, AD = BC and AB = CD.

   Given that AB = 6 cm, it implies that CD = 6 cm.

3. **Length of segment BC:**
   Since AC is a diagonal of the rectangle and it's given that AC = 10 cm, using the Pythagorean theorem:

   AB² + BC² = AC²
   6² + BC² = 10²
   36 + BC² = 100
   BC² = 64
   BC = 8 cm.

4. **Length of segment CX:**
   Since ΔBCX is similar to ΔBAC (both are right triangles and have a common angle at B), we can set up a proportion:

   BX/AB = CX/BC
   Let's let BX = y cm.

   y/6 = (8 - y)/8
   8y = 48 - 6y
   14y = 48
   y = 48/14
   y = 3.4286 cm (rounded to four decimal places)

5. **Length of segment AX:**
   AX = AC - CX
   AX = 10 - 8
   AX = 2 cm

6. **Length of segment XM (distance from X to the midpoint M):**
   Since M is the midpoint of AC, AM = MC = 10/2 = 5 cm.
   Thus, XM = AM - AX
   XM = 5 cm - 2 cm
   XM = 3 cm

Therefore, point X is 3 cm away from the midpoint M of the diagonal AC.

Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step-by-step.

**Step 1:** Notice that triangle $DAO$ is an isosceles triangle. This means that angles $OAD$ and $ODA$ are congruent. Since the three angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\circ}$, and we know that one of the angles (angle $DOA$) is $180^{\circ} - 2\theta$ (where $\theta$ is the measure of angles $OAD$ and $ODA$), each of the two congruent angles must be $\theta = \frac{1}{2} \times (180^{\circ} - (180^{\circ} - 2\theta)) = 90^{\circ} - \theta$.

**Step 2:** Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $DAO$, we can solve for $OD$. Let $OD = x$.

\[x^2 + x^2 = 10^2\]
\[2x^2 = 100\]
\[x^2 = 50\]
\[x = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}\]

Therefore, $OD = 5\sqrt{2}$.

**Step 3:** Now, $DO + OC = 12$. So, $OC = 12 - 5\sqrt{2}$.

**Step 4:** Notice that triangle $OBC$ is also isosceles and has the same properties as triangle $DAO$. Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $OBC$ and setting $OB$ as the hypotenuse, we get:

\[OB^2 = OC^2 + BC^2\]
\[10^2 = (12 - 5\sqrt{2})^2 + x^2\]

Where $x$ is the height of triangle $OBC$ from $O$ to $BC$.

**Step 5:** Expanding and simplifying:

\[100 = 144 - 120\sqrt{2} + 50 + x^2\]
\[x^2 = 6\sqrt{2} - 94\]
\[x = \sqrt{6\sqrt{2} - 94}\]

**Step 6:** Finally, notice that the height of the entire trapezoid from $O$ to $AB$ is the sum of the heights of triangles $DAO$ and $OBC$. So, $OP = 5\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6\sqrt{2} - 94}$.

And that's your answer: \( OP = 5\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6\sqrt{2} - 94} \).

Sure, let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Identify Known Quantities
We are given:
- Square ABCD has side lengths of 4.
- Triangle ABE is equilateral, so all sides of ABE have length 4.
- Line segment BE and AC intersect at P.

Step 2: Find Lengths of Segments in Triangle ABE

Since ABE is equilateral, each of its angles measures \(60^\circ\). Thus, \(\angle AEB = 60^\circ\).

Step 3: Relationship between Triangles ABE and APQ

We see that \(\triangle APQ\) is a 30-60-90 right triangle. This is because:
- \(\angle APB\) is half of \(\angle AEB\) (as they share the same arc AE), making it \(30^\circ\).
- \(\angle APQ\) is a right angle by definition.

Step 4: Lengths in a 30-60-90 Triangle

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratios of the sides opposite these angles are:
- Opposite \(30^\circ\): \(s\)
- Opposite \(60^\circ\): \(s\sqrt{3}\)
- Opposite \(90^\circ\): \(2s\)

Step 5: Apply to Triangle APQ

In \(\triangle APQ\):
- \(PQ\) (opposite \(30^\circ\)) has length \(x\).
- \(AP\) (opposite \(60^\circ\)) will have length \(x\sqrt{3}\).
- \(AB\) (opposite \(90^\circ\)) has length 4.

Using the 30-60-90 triangle relationships, we can determine that the length \(AP = \frac{1}{2} \times AB\).

Therefore:
\[ x\sqrt{3} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]
\[ x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \]

To rationalize the denominator:
\[ x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \]

So, \(x = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}\).

3. So, the measure of angle \( ABC \) is:
\[ 180° - 35° - 35° = 110° \]

4. Angle \( ABC \) and angle \( CDA \) are on a straight line, so they are supplementary. 

5. Thus, the measure of angle \( CDA \) is:
\[ 180° - 110° = 70° \]

The sum of the interior angles of any polygon is given by:
\[ \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ \]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a heptagon, \( n = 7 \).

Therefore, the sum of the interior angles of a heptagon is:
\[ (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ \]

Since the heptagon is regular, all its angles are equal. So, the measure of each interior angle is:
\[ \text{Interior angle of heptagon} = \frac{900^\circ}{7} = 128\frac{4}{7}^\circ \]

2. **Determine the Sum of the Angles in the Quadrilateral:**
The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \). One of the angles is \( x \) (given), and the other three angles are each \( 128\frac{4}{7}^\circ \) (from the heptagon).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 3 \times 128\frac{4}{7}^\circ = 360^\circ \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
Expanding the right side:
\[ x + 385\frac{2}{7}^\circ = 360^\circ \]

Subtracting \( 385\frac{2}{7}^\circ \) from each side:
\[ x = 360^\circ - 385\frac{2}{7}^\circ \]
\[ x = -25\frac{2}{7}^\circ \]

However, a negative angle doesn't make sense in this context. The angle \( x \) is an exterior angle of the heptagon and can be found as:
\[ x = 180^\circ - 128\frac{4}{7}^\circ \]
\[ x = 51\frac{2}{7}^\circ \]

So, the measure of \( x \) is \( 51\frac{2}{7}^\circ \).

To find the area of the trapezoid, we first need to determine the height. We can do this using the Pythagorean theorem.

Let \( h \) be the height (or altitude) of the trapezoid drawn perpendicular to the bases \( AB \) and \( CD \). Let \( E \) be the point where the altitude intersects \( AB \). So, \( DE \) is the height of the trapezoid.

To determine the height, we can use triangle \( CDE \).

1. First, find the length \( CE \):

\( CE \) is the difference in lengths between the two bases: 
\[ CE = AB - CD = 52 - 39 = 13 \]

2. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( CDE \):
\[ CD^2 = CE^2 + DE^2 \]
Given that \( CD = 39 \) and \( CE = 13 \), we have:
\[ 39^2 = 13^2 + DE^2 \]
\[ 1521 = 169 + DE^2 \]
\[ DE^2 = 1521 - 169 \]
\[ DE^2 = 1352 \]
\[ DE = \sqrt{1352} = 36.8 \] (rounded to one decimal place)

So, the height \( h = 36.8 \) units.

3. The area of a trapezoid is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} (a + b) h \]
Where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the parallel sides (bases) and \( h \) is the height.
Given \( a = 52 \), \( b = 39 \), and \( h = 36.8 \):
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} (52 + 39) \times 36.8 \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} (91) \times 36.8 \]
\[ \text{Area} = 1674.4 \]

Thus, the area of trapezoid \( ABCD \) is \( 1674.4 \) square units.

2. **Calculate the Area of One Triangle**:
   The height of one of these isosceles triangles can be found using trigonometry. Let's call the height \( h \).
   
   Using one of the triangles:
   \( \sin(22.5^\circ) = \frac{h}{1} \)
   
   Thus, 
   \( h = \sin(22.5^\circ) \)
   
   Now, the area of one triangle is:
   \( \frac{1}{2} \times base \times height = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times h = h \)

3. **Find the Area of a Sector**:
   The area of a sector corresponding to the central angle of 45 degrees is:
   \( Area_{sector} = \frac{45^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{1}{8} \pi \)

4. **Shaded Area Calculation**:
   The total area of one such shaded triangle (with the curve) is:
   \( Area_{shaded triangle} = h - \frac{1}{8} \pi \)
   
   Since there are 4 such triangles in the image, the total shaded area is:
   \( 4 \times (h - \frac{1}{8} \pi) \)

   Substituting for \( h \):
   \( Shaded Area = 4 \times (\sin(22.5^\circ) - \frac{1}{8} \pi) \)

Let's calculate this value to get the final answer.

Using the identity:

\[ \sin(22.5^\circ) = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(45^\circ)}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{2}} \]
\[ = \sqrt{\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2}} \]

Now, plugging this value into our shaded area formula:

\[ Shaded Area = 4 \times (\sqrt{\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2}} - \frac{1}{8} \pi) \]

Expanding:

\[ Shaded Area = 4\sqrt{\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2}} - \frac{1}{2} \pi \]

**Step 1**: First, let's get the height of $\triangle ABC$ in terms of $r$.

Since $PQRS$ is a rectangle (from tangencies), the height of the triangle will be $1 + r + 1 = 2 + r$. This is because the height includes the radii of circles $P$, $R$ and the segment from the top of circle $P$ to the base of the triangle.

**Step 2**: Find the base length of $\triangle ABC$.

The base length includes the diameter of circles $Q$, $R$, and $S$ which is $2(1 + r + 1) = 4 + 2r$.

**Step 3**: Find the area of $\triangle ABC$ before and after the decrease in radius.

Before:
\[ Area = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 6 = 9 \]
After:
\[ Area = \frac{1}{2} \times (2 + r) \times (4 + 2r) \]
\[ = r^2 + 3r + 4 \]

**Step 4**: Equate the two areas.

Since the total area remains unchanged (because the total space occupied by circles $Q$, $P$, and $S$ remain unchanged and circle $R$'s reduction is made up by the triangle area):

\[ r^2 + 3r + 4 = 9 \]
\[ r^2 + 3r - 5 = 0 \]

To solve this quadratic, use the quadratic formula:

\[ r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, $a = 1$, $b = 3$, and $c = -5$.

\[ r = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} \]

So, $r = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$.

Thus, $a+b+c = -3 + 29 + 2 = \boxed{28}$.

The tangent line drawn from a point to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. Thus, the radius \( \overline{AE} \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{CE} \). 

**Step 2:**
The radius \( \overline{AE} \) is half of the side length of the square because it is the radius of the semicircle with diameter \( \overline{AB} \). Thus, \( AE = AB/2 = 2/2 = 1 \).

**Step 3:**
Since \( AE \) is perpendicular to \( CE \) and \( AC \) is the diagonal of the square, triangle \( AEC \) is a right triangle with \( AE \) as one of its legs.

**Step 4:**
The diagonal \( AC \) of square \( ABCD \) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. We have:

\( AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \)

Since \( AB = 2 \) and \( BC = 2 \),
\( AC^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 8 \)
So, \( AC = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \)

**Step 5:**
Now, let's denote \( CE \) as \( x \). Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle \( AEC \), we have:

\( AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2 \)
Given \( AE = 1 \) and \( AC = 2\sqrt{2} \),
\( 1^2 + x^2 = (2\sqrt{2})^2 \)
=> \( 1 + x^2 = 8 \)

Step 1: Labeling
From the diagram you provided, after folding, the original point A coincides with a point on the side BC. Let's call this point D.

Step 2: Identifying right triangles
Because the paper is rectangular, we know that angle ABC is 90 degrees. When the paper is folded, angle A becomes angle D, which means angle ADC is also 90 degrees.

Step 5: Using the Pythagorean theorem on Triangle ADC
Now we can find CD, which will be the length of the fold l.

We can see that triangle \( ADC \) is an isosceles triangle because \( AD = DC \). This means that angles \( DAC \) and \( ACD \) are congruent.

**Step 3**: Use the information about the isosceles triangle.
We're given that \( m\angle ACD = 22.5^\circ \). Therefore:
\[ m\angle DAC = m\angle ACD = 22.5^\circ \]

**Step 4**: Determine \( m\angle ADC \).
In a triangle, the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \). Using this:
\[ m\angle ADC = 180^\circ - m\angle DAC - m\angle ACD \]
\[ m\angle ADC = 180^\circ - 22.5^\circ - 22.5^\circ \]
\[ m\angle ADC = 135^\circ \]

**Step 5**: Determine \( m\angle ABC \).
In triangle \( ABC \), \( m\angle ABC + m\angle BAC + m\angle BCA = 180^\circ \).
We also know that:
\[ m\angle BAC = m\angle DAC + m\angle BAD \]
\[ m\angle BAC = 22.5^\circ + 22.5^\circ \]
\[ m\angle BAC = 45^\circ \]
(Here, we used the fact that \( BAD \) is half of \( BAD + DAC \) since \( BA = AD \) making triangle \( ABD \) also isosceles.)

Finally:
\[ m\angle BCA = m\angle ACD + m\angle ADC \]
\[ m\angle BCA = 22.5^\circ + 135^\circ \]
\[ m\angle BCA = 157.5^\circ \]

Now, summing up the angles of triangle \( ABC \):
\[ m\angle ABC + 45^\circ + 157.5^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ m\angle ABC = -22.5^\circ + 180^\circ \]
\[ m\angle ABC = 157.5^\circ \]

Therefore, the measure of angle \( ABC \) is \( 157.5^\circ \).

1. **Identify Relevant Lengths**: 
   - The side length of square $ABGH$ is $AH = 5$ units.
   - The side length of square $BCDF$ is $CD = 10$ units.
   
2. **Triangles with Equal Areas**:
   - Observe that triangle $ABE$ and triangle $EFC$ are similar by AA similarity (because of the right angles at B and F and the angles ABE and FEC which are corresponding angles of the two squares).
   - Using the properties of similar triangles, we can determine the ratio of the sides of these two triangles.
   
3. **Determine the Ratio of Similar Triangles**:
   - The ratio of the side lengths of the two squares is $5:10$, which simplifies to $1:2$. So, the sides of triangle $ABE$ are half the corresponding sides of triangle $EFC$.
   - Since area is proportional to the square of the side length, the area of triangle $ABE$ is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$ of the area of triangle $EFC$.
   
4. **Find Area of Triangle $EFC$**:
   - The base of triangle $EFC$ is $EF$, which is 10 units (because $EF$ is the side of square $BCDF$).
   - The height of triangle $EFC$ with respect to base $EF$ is the distance from $E$ to $DC$, which is $10 - 5 = 5$ units (because $ED$ minus $AH$ is the height).
   - The area of triangle $EFC$ is: $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5 = 25$ square units.
   
5. **Find Area of Triangle $ABE$**:
   - Using our similarity ratio, the area of triangle $ABE$ is $\frac{1}{4}$ of the area of triangle $EFC$. So, the area of triangle $ABE$ is: $\frac{1}{4} \times 25 = \frac{25}{4}$ square units.

Therefore, the area of triangle $ABE$ is $\boxed{\frac{25}{4}}$ or $6\frac{1}{4}$ square units.

1. First, consider triangles \( \triangle PYW \) and \( \triangle PVW \). They share the same height from point \( P \). Since the ratio of sides \( VY:YW = 4:3 \), the area of triangle \( \triangle PVY \) to \( \triangle PYW \) is also \( 4:3 \).

Given that \( \triangle PZW \) has an area of 35 and \( \triangle PVW \) has an area of 70, the ratio of \( WZ \) to \( VW \) is \( 1:2 \).

They all share the same height from point \( P \) and have the bases \( UX \), \( ZX \), and \( WX \), respectively.

6. Given that the sum of the areas of \( \triangle PZX \) and \( \triangle PWX \) is \( 35 + 30 = 65 \), the area of \( \triangle PUX \) is also 65. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle UXP \) is \( 65 - 30 = 35 \).

To find the area of the shaded region, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the circle with radius half the length of the diameter.
2. Calculate the area of triangle \( ABC \).
3. Subtract the area of triangle \( ABC \) from the area of the circle.

Step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the area of circle \( P \) with diameter \( AB \)**
Given \( AB \) (the diameter) is 4 cm, the radius \( r \) of circle \( P \) is half of that, which is \( r = 2 \) cm.
Using the formula for the area of a circle \( A = \pi r^2 \):
\[ A = \pi (2^2) \]
\[ A = 4\pi \] square cm.

2. **Calculate the area of triangle \( ABC \)**
Triangle \( ABC \) is a right triangle because the angle subtended by the diameter of a circle is always 90°.
Given:
Base \( BC \) = 2 cm
Height \( AC \) = radius of circle \( P \) = 2 cm

\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \]
\[ A = 2 \] square cm.

3. **Find the area of the shaded region**
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = \text{Area of circle} - \text{Area of triangle} \]
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 4\pi - 2 \]
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 4\pi - 2 \] square cm.

Given the properties of an orthocenter in a triangle, we can say that $AH$ is perpendicular to $BC$, $BH$ is perpendicular to $AC$, and $CH$ is perpendicular to $AB$. This makes the orthocenter, $H$, the intersection of the three altitudes.

To find the length of $HE$, we can use properties of similar triangles.

Consider triangles $BEH$ and $CDH$.

Both of these triangles share angle $H$, and both are right triangles (because of the altitudes). This means that if we can prove another angle in $BEH$ is congruent to another angle in $CDH$, the two triangles will be similar.

Notice that:
1. $\angle CBE$ is complementary to $\angle CBH$ because $BE$ is the altitude and therefore is perpendicular to $AC$. 
2. $\angle CDH$ is also complementary to $\angle CBH$ because $DH$ is an altitude and is perpendicular to $AB$.

Therefore, $\angle CBE \cong \angle CDH$. This gives us our second pair of congruent angles. So, $\triangle BEH \sim \triangle CDH$ by AA similarity.

Because these two triangles are similar, we can set up the following proportion using their corresponding sides:

\[\frac{HE}{DH} = \frac{BE}{CD}\]

Given that $BE = \frac{42}{5}$ and $CD = 9$, we can plug these values into our equation:

\[\frac{HE}{DH} = \frac{\frac{42}{5}}{9}\]

Now, observe triangle $BDC$. Since $BE$ is an altitude of $\triangle ABC$, it's perpendicular to $AC$, and thus, $AC \parallel DH$. This makes $\triangle BDC$ a trapezoid. So, the height of this trapezoid (which is the perpendicular distance between $AC$ and $BD$) is shared between $BE$ and $DE$.

This gives:

\[DE + BE = CD\]
\[DE = CD - BE\]
\[DE = 9 - \frac{42}{5} = \frac{3}{5}\]

Now, since $HE = DH - DE$, we have:

\[HE = DH - \frac{3}{5}\]

Substitute this into our earlier proportion:

\[\frac{DH - \frac{3}{5}}{DH} = \frac{\frac{42}{5}}{9}\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[9(DH - \frac{3}{5}) = \frac{42}{5} \cdot DH\]
\[9DH - \frac{27}{5} = \frac{42}{5}DH\]

Multiplying everything by 5:

\[45DH - 27 = 42DH\]
\[3DH = 27\]
\[DH = 9\]

Now, using $HE = DH - \frac{3}{5}$, we get:

\[HE = 9 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{42}{5}\]

Thus, $HE = \boxed{\frac{42}{5}}$.

Given radius \( r = 6 \text{cm} \),
\[ A_{circle} = \pi (6^2) = 36\pi \text{cm}^2 \]

2. **Curved Surface Area of Cylinder**:
This is the lateral or side area of the cylinder. The formula for this is \( A = 2\pi r h \). But since it's cut in half, it would be \( \frac{2\pi r h}{2} = \pi r h \).
Given height \( h = 10 \text{cm} \) and radius \( r = 6 \text{cm} \),
\[ A_{curved} = \pi (6)(10) = 60\pi \text{cm}^2 \]

3. **Flat Rectangular Side Surface Area**:
This is the flat area formed when you cut the cylinder in half. The length of the rectangle will be the same as the circumference of the circle (since it's essentially "unrolling" the curved surface), and the width will be the same as the height of the cylinder.
The circumference \( C = 2\pi r = 2\pi(6) = 12\pi \text{cm} \).
So, the area of the rectangle is \( A = C \times h \).
\[ A_{rectangle} = 12\pi (10) = 120\pi \text{cm}^2 \]

Now, sum up the areas:
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = A_{circle} + A_{curved} + A_{rectangle} \]
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 36\pi + 60\pi + 120\pi \]
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 216\pi \text{cm}^2 \]

So, the total surface area, in terms of \( \pi \), of the solid is \( 216\pi \text{cm}^2 \).

Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the non-hexagonal faces:** 
The non-hexagonal faces of a right hexagonal prism are its lateral faces. Since it's a hexagonal prism, there are 6 rectangular lateral faces.

2. **Determine the dimensions of one of the lateral rectangular faces:** 
The height of the prism is the height of each of the rectangular faces, which is given as 3 feet. 
The width of each rectangle is the same as the edge length of the hexagonal base, which is given as 6 inches or 0.5 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot).

3. **Calculate the area of one of the lateral rectangular faces:**
Area = height × width
Area = 3 feet × 0.5 feet = 1.5 square feet

4. **Calculate the combined area of all the lateral faces:**
Since there are 6 lateral faces, the combined area is:
Total area = 6 × 1.5 square feet = 9 square feet

Alright! Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Find the side length of the squares.**

From the problem, we know that the squares have a side length of 4 units.

**Step 2: Find the area of the squares combined.**

Each square has an area of \(4 \times 4 = 16\) square units. Since the two squares overlap and share a quarter of their areas, we need to subtract that overlapping quarter once.

Combined area of squares:
\(2 \times 16 - 16/4 = 32 - 4 = 28\) square units.

**Step 3: Find the diameter of the circle.**

The diameter of the circle is the segment between the two points of intersection. Since each of the squares is bisected by the other square, the segment from the center of one square to its edge (or half the side of the square) is 2 units. So, the diameter of the circle is \(2 + 2 = 4\) units.

**Step 4: Find the radius of the circle.**

The radius is half of the diameter, so \(r = 4/2 = 2\) units.

**Step 5: Find the area of the circle.**

Using the formula for the area of a circle, \(A = \pi r^2\):
\[A = \pi (2^2) = 4\pi\] square units.

**Step 6: Find the area of the shaded region.**

To find the area of the shaded region, subtract the area of the circle from the combined area of the squares:

**Step 2:** Find the length of $HC$.
$HC = BC - BH = 9 - 6 = 3$ units.

**Step 3:** Use similar triangles to find the length of $GH$.
Triangles $GEC$ and $HAB$ are similar since both are right triangles and have a common angle at $H$.

Using the properties of similar triangles:
$\frac{GH}{AB} = \frac{CE}{HA}$
Given $HA = HC + AB = 3 + 8 = 11$ units
$\Rightarrow \frac{GH}{8} = \frac{4}{11}$
$\Rightarrow GH = \frac{4 \times 8}{11} = \frac{32}{11} = 2\frac{10}{11}$ units.

**Step 4:** Use the properties of similar triangles to find the length of $GE$.
Triangles $GEC$ and $FDA$ are similar because both are right triangles and $\angle FDA = \angle GEC$.

Using the properties of similar triangles:
$\frac{GE}{FD} = \frac{CE}{DA}$
Given $DA = DE + EA = 4 + 8 = 12$ units
$\Rightarrow \frac{GE}{8} = \frac{4}{12}$
$\Rightarrow GE = \frac{4 \times 8}{12} = \frac{32}{12} = 2\frac{8}{12} = 2\frac{2}{3}$ units.

$AF = AE + EF = 8 + 2\frac{2}{3} = 10\frac{2}{3}$ units

Thus, $GF = 13\frac{10}{11} - 10\frac{2}{3} = 3\frac{4}{11}$ units.

Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the measure of angle $\angle ABC$.

Given $\angle BAC = 42^\circ$ and $AC = AB$ (which means $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles), the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent. Therefore, $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$. 

Using the fact that the angles of a triangle sum to $180^\circ$, we can find $\angle ABC$:
$$\angle ABC + \angle ACB + \angle BAC = 180^\circ$$
$$2(\angle ABC) + 42^\circ = 180^\circ$$
$$2(\angle ABC) = 138^\circ$$
$$\angle ABC = 69^\circ$$

Step 2: Find the measure of angle $\angle BCA$ using the Inscribed Angle Theorem.

In a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since $\angle ABC$ intercepts the arc $AC$, and we have found that $\angle ABC = 69^\circ$, the measure of arc $AC$ is $2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ$. 

Since $\angle BCA$ intercepts arc $BA$, and the circle has a total of $360^\circ$, the measure of arc $BA$ is $360^\circ - 138^\circ = 222^\circ$. 

Therefore, using the Inscribed Angle Theorem again, 
$$\angle BCA = \frac{1}{2} \times 222^\circ = 111^\circ$$

Step 3: Find the measure of angle $\angle ACD$ using the Tangent-Chord Theorem.

The Tangent-Chord Theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. In this case, $\angle ACD$ is formed by the tangent $ED$ and the chord $AC$, and intercepts arc $AB$. 

Using the theorem:
$$\angle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times 222^\circ = 111^\circ$$

Thus, the measure of $\angle ACD$ is $111^\circ$.

Let's use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the sides of the triangle ABC.

First, let's call the lengths of the two right triangles, APB and APC, as \( x \) and \( y \) respectively. So, the side length of the isosceles triangle \( s \) is \( x + y \).

From triangle APC:
\[ (x + y)^2 = 11^2 + 6^2 \]
\[ x + y = \sqrt{157} \]
Since \( x = y \) (because ABC is an isosceles triangle), we have:
\[ x = y = \frac{\sqrt{157}}{2} \]

Next, in triangle BP:
\[ x^2 + 7^2 = (x + y)^2 \]
Plugging in the value of \( x \) we get:
\[ \left(\frac{\sqrt{157}}{2}\right)^2 + 49 = \left(\sqrt{157}\right)^2 \]
\[ \frac{157}{4} + 49 = 157 \]
\[ 157/4 + 196/4 = 628/4 \]
\[ 353/4 = 628/4 \]

The above doesn't hold true, so we must have made a mistake in our assumption. 

Actually, because of the placement of point P, it's possible that triangle APB is not necessarily a right triangle. So, let's use the law of cosines to express the relationship between the sides of triangle APB.

For triangle APB:

\[ x^2 = 7^2 + 11^2 - 2(7)(11)\cos(\angle APB) \]
\[ \angle APB = \angle APC \]
\[ \cos(\angle APC) = \frac{11^2 + 6^2 - x^2}{2(11)(6)} \]

Plugging in the above in our first equation:

\[ x^2 = 7^2 + 11^2 - 2(7)(11) \times \frac{11^2 + 6^2 - x^2}{2(11)(6)} \]

By simplifying and solving the above equation, we can get the value of \( x \).

Using the Pythagoras theorem for triangle APC:

\[ x^2 + 6^2 = (x + y)^2 \]

Using the above, you can determine the value of \( y \).

The value of \( s = x + y \).

Plugging in the values we got, you can then solve for \( s \) and get the desired form \( \sqrt{a + b\sqrt{2}} \) to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

   Area of $ADF = \frac{1}{2} \times w \times h_2 = 5$

   Area of $CEF = \frac{1}{2} \times w \times h_3 = 9$

   $h_1 = \frac{16}{w}$

   $h_2 = \frac{10}{w}$

   $h_3 = \frac{18}{w}$

4. **Expressing the Length of the Rectangle**:
   The length of the rectangle $ABCD$ is equal to the sum of the heights of the triangles $ABE$, $ADF$, and $CEF$ (because the triangles are stacked on top of each other along the length of the rectangle):

   Length $= h_1 + h_2 + h_3$

   Length $= \frac{16}{w} + \frac{10}{w} + \frac{18}{w}$

   Length $= \frac{44}{w}$

5. **Expressing the Area of the Rectangle**:
   Area of rectangle $ABCD = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}$
   
   Area of $ABCD = w \times \frac{44}{w}$

   Area of $ABCD = 44$

As the card is opened, point A remains stationary since it's on the fold, while point B moves along an arc of a circle. The radius of this circle is the length from point A to point B, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.

1. First, find the distance between point A and point B:
   Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \(AB^2\) = \(3^2\) + \(6^2\)
   \(AB^2\) = 9 + 36
   \(AB^2\) = 45
   \(AB\) = \(\sqrt{45}\)
   \(AB\) = \(3\sqrt{5}\) inches.

2. The path B takes forms an arc of a circle with a radius of \(3\sqrt{5}\) inches, centered at point A. 
   
3. Since the card opens to an angle of 45 degrees, this is 1/8th of a full circle (because 360/45 = 8). 

4. To find the length of the arc through which point B travels, we'll use the formula:
   Arc length = \(\frac{angle}{360}\) × \(2π × radius\)

5. Plugging in our values:
   Arc length = \(\frac{45}{360}\) × \(2π × 3\sqrt{5}\)
              = \(\frac{1}{8}\) × \(6π\sqrt{5}\)
              = \(\frac{3}{4}π\sqrt{5}\)

6. To find how much farther point B travels than point A, subtract the straight-line distance point A travels (which is the width of the card) from the arc length point B travels.

   Difference = Arc length - Width
              = \(\frac{3}{4}π\sqrt{5}\) - 6
              = \(\frac{3}{4}π\sqrt{5}\) - \(\frac{24}{4}\)
              = \(\frac{3π\sqrt{5} - 24}{4}\)

Thus, point B travels \(\frac{3π\sqrt{5} - 24}{4}\) inches more than point A.

The shaded region is a triangle with base \( \overline{BC} \) and height \( \overline{AE} \).

Given that $ABCD$ is a rectangle four times as long as it is wide, let the width be \( w \). Then, the length will be \( 4w \).

Area of triangle \( ABE \) (shaded region) is \( \frac{1}{2} \times base \times height \) or \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2w \times w = w^2 \).

Step 2: Find the area of the entire rectangle.
Area of rectangle \( ABCD \) is \( width \times length \) or \( w \times 4w = 4w^2 \).

Step 3: Calculate the percentage.
\[ \text{Percentage of shaded region} = \left( \frac{\text{Area of shaded region}}{\text{Area of rectangle}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of shaded region} = \left( \frac{w^2}{4w^2} \right) \times 100\% \]

3. \( BD \) can be split into two segments: \( BD1 \) (from \( B \) to where it meets \( AC \)) and \( BD2 \) (from where \( BD \) meets \( AC \) to \( D \)).
4. Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle (the half-equilateral triangle), we know:
   - The side opposite the 30° angle (in this case \( BD2 \)) is half the length of the hypotenuse (which is \( x \)).
   - Therefore, \( BD2 = \frac{1}{2}x \).
   - The side opposite the 60° angle (in this case \( BD1 \)) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side opposite the 30° angle.
   - Thus, \( BD1 = \sqrt{3} \times BD2 = \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x \).

5. From this, we find that \( BD = BD1 + BD2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x = x(\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{2}) \).
   
Using the formula for the area of a triangle:

6. Area of triangle \( BDC \) = \( \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times BD = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times x(\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{2}) = \frac{x^2(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{4} \).

7. Area of triangle \( ADC \) = \( \frac{1}{2} \times DC \times BD = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times x(\frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{2}) = \frac{x^2(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{4} \).

Notice that the areas of triangles \( BDC \) and \( ADC \) are the same because their bases (BC and DC) are congruent in an equilateral triangle \( ABC \).

Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle \( BDC \) to the area of triangle \( ADC \) is \( 1:1 \) or \( \frac{1}{1} \), which simplifies to \( 1 \).

To determine the measure of angle \( GCE \), we need to analyze the various angles given in the figure:

1. Since \( ABCD \) and \( BEFG \) are squares, each interior angle of these squares is \( 90^\circ \).

2. \( BCE \) is an equilateral triangle. Hence, each angle of triangle \( BCE \) is \( 60^\circ \).

Let's begin our reasoning:

i) Angle \( BCE \) is an angle of the equilateral triangle \( BCE \), so it is \( 60^\circ \).

ii) Angle \( BCG \) is a right angle since it's an interior angle of square \( ABCD \). Thus, \( BCG = 90^\circ \).

iii) Now, to determine the measure of angle \( GCE \), we observe that the angles \( BCE \), \( BCG \), and \( GCE \) form a straight line. The sum of angles on a straight line is \( 180^\circ \).

Using the information from i) and ii), we can determine angle \( GCE \):

\( GCE = 180^\circ - (BCE + BCG) \)

\( GCE = 180^\circ - (60^\circ + 90^\circ) \)

\( GCE = 180^\circ - 150^\circ \)

\( GCE = 30^\circ \).

Therefore, angle \( GCE \) is \( 30^\circ \).

Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. **Define the Unknowns**:
   Let the length of the smaller rectangle be \( l \) and the width be \( w \).

2. **Write the Relationships from the Given Information**:
   Since the five rectangles are congruent, they all have the same dimensions: \( l \) and \( w \).
   From the image, we can observe that the large rectangle has a length that is made up of 3 widths (\( 3w \)) and a width that is made up of 2 lengths (\( 2l \)).

3. **Use the Given Perimeter of the Large Rectangle**:
   The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
   \( P = 2l + 2w \)
   Given that the perimeter of the large rectangle is 176 units, we can set up the equation using the dimensions we derived:
   \( 176 = 2(2l) + 2(3w) \)
   \( 176 = 4l + 6w \)

4. **Express \( w \) in terms of \( l \) or vice-versa**:
   From the diagram, the width of the big rectangle (which is \( 2l \)) plus one of the smaller rectangles' width (which is \( w \)) equals its length (which is \( 3w \)).
   Thus, \( 2l + w = 3w \)
   Simplifying, we get:
   \( 2l = 2w \)
   \( l = w \)

5. **Substitute the Expression for \( l \) in the Equation for the Perimeter**:
   Using \( l = w \) in \( 176 = 4l + 6w \):
   \( 176 = 4w + 6w \)
   \( 176 = 10w \)
   \( w = 17.6 \)
   And since \( l = w \):
   \( l = 17.6 \)

6. **Find the Perimeter of One of the Smaller Rectangles**:
   Using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:
   \( P = 2l + 2w \)
   \( P = 2(17.6) + 2(17.6) \)
   \( P = 35.2 + 35.2 \)
   \( P = 70.4 \)

The perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is 70.4 units.

Certainly! Let's use properties of triangles, specifically properties of medians and altitudes to solve this problem.

Let's denote:
\[AB = x\]
\[BC = y\]
\[AC = z\]

Since \(BD\) is a median to side \(AC\), it divides \(AC\) into two segments of equal length. Therefore, 
\[AD = DC = \frac{z}{2}\]

Given \(BD = 2 \cdot DE\), we can say:
\[BD = 2z - 2 \cdot DE\]

Given that \(BE\) is an altitude, it divides triangle \(ABC\) into two similar triangles, \(ABE\) and \(BCE\). We can use the properties of similar triangles to express \(BE\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\).

Since the triangles are similar:
\[\frac{BE}{x} = \frac{x}{y}\]
\[BE = \frac{x^2}{y}\]

Similarly:
\[\frac{BE}{y} = \frac{y}{x}\]
\[BE = \frac{y^2}{x}\]

Equating both expressions for \(BE\):
\[\frac{x^2}{y} = \frac{y^2}{x}\]
\[x^3 = y^3\]
\[x = y\]

Now, triangle \(ABC\) is an isosceles right triangle. Therefore:
\[x = y = \frac{z}{\sqrt{2}}\]

Now, \(DE\) can be computed in terms of \(z\):
\[BD + DE = z\]
\[2z - 2 \cdot DE + DE = z\]
\[DE = z\]

Substituting for \(z\):
\[DE = \frac{x\sqrt{2}}{2}\]

Now, \(EC = AC - AE\)
\[EC = z - (BD + DE)\]
\[EC = z - 3z = -2z\]

This is not possible. We made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and re-evaluate.

The length of \(DE\) was derived from \(BD = 2 \cdot DE\). Thus:
\[DE = \frac{z}{3}\]

Then, \(BD = 2 \cdot \frac{z}{3} = \frac{2z}{3}\)

So:
\[AE = BD + DE = \frac{2z}{3} + \frac{z}{3} = z\]

Since \(AE = AC\), it implies:
\[EC = 0\]

So the ratio \(\frac{AB}{EC}\) is undefined since \(EC = 0\).

In conclusion, the ratio \(\frac{AB}{EC}\) is undefined.

Alright, let's break down the problem step by step.

Given:
1. Each triangle is an isosceles right triangle (a 45-45-90 triangle).
2. The length of $\overline{BC}$ is 2 units.

Using the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle, if the two legs are of length "x", then the hypotenuse is $x\sqrt{2}$.

Step 1: Find the lengths of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$.
Since $\overline{BC}$ is the hypotenuse of the right triangle $\triangle ABC$ and is of length 2 units, then each of its legs (i.e., $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$) will have a length of $2/\sqrt{2}$. Simplifying this, we get:
$$\overline{AB} = \overline{AC} = 2/\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}/\sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}/2 = \sqrt{2} \text{ units}.$$

Step 2: Find the length of $\overline{AD}$.
$\overline{AD}$ is the hypotenuse of the right triangle $\triangle ABD$, which has $\overline{AB}$ as one of its legs. Thus, $\overline{AD}$ is:
$$\overline{AD} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2} = 2 \text{ units}.$$

Step 3: Find the length of $\overline{CD}$.
$\overline{CD}$ is the leg of the right triangle $\triangle ACD$. It's equal in length to $\overline{AC}$, which is:
$$\overline{CD} = \sqrt{2} \text{ units}.$$

Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of quadrilateral $ABCD$.
$$\text{Perimeter} = \overline{AB} + \overline{BC} + \overline{CD} + \overline{AD}$$
$$\text{Perimeter} = \sqrt{2} + 2 + \sqrt{2} + 2$$
$$\text{Perimeter} = 4 + 2\sqrt{2} \text{ units}.$$

So, the perimeter of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $4 + 2\sqrt{2}$ units.

Alright, let's solve this step by step.

**Step 1**: Calculate the area of the large semicircle.
The radius of the large semicircle is 2 units. So, the area of the large semicircle is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times 2^2 = 2\pi \]

**Step 2**: Calculate the area of one of the smaller semicircles.
The radius of the smaller semicircle is 1 unit. So, the area of a smaller semicircle is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{1}{2}\pi \]

Since there are 3 such semicircles, the total area of all 3 smaller semicircles is:
\[ 3 \times \frac{1}{2}\pi = \frac{3}{2}\pi \]

**Step 3**: Subtract the total area of the three smaller semicircles from the area of the large semicircle to get the shaded area.
Shaded area = Area of large semicircle - Total area of smaller semicircles
\[ \text{Shaded area} = 2\pi - \frac{3}{2}\pi \]

\[ \text{Shaded area} = \frac{1}{2}\pi \]

So, the area of the shaded region is \( \boxed{\frac{1}{2}\pi} \) units^2.

Alright, let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Establish the given information.**

We have two squares, $ABCD$ and $EFGH$, which are equal in area. Also, point $J$ is the midpoint of $GH$. Since squares are symmetrical figures, the diagonal divides the square into two triangles of equal area.

**Step 2: Calculate the area of triangle $ABC$ and $EHC$ separately.**

Both triangles are right triangles, and both are half the area of their respective squares. Let's say each square has a side length of $s$. The area of each square is $s^2$. So, the area of triangle $ABC$ (or $EHC$) is half of that, which is $0.5s^2$.

**Step 3: Calculate the area of triangle $HCJ$.**

$J$ is the midpoint of $GH$. Thus, $HJ$ is half the length of side $GH$, which is $0.5s$.
Triangle $HCJ$ is a right triangle (because squares have right angles) with base $CH$ and height $HJ$.
The area of triangle $HCJ$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times s \times 0.5s = 0.25s^2$.

**Step 4: Sum the shaded areas.**

The shaded region consists of triangle $ABC$ and triangle $EHC$ minus triangle $HCJ$.

Shaded Area = $0.5s^2 + 0.5s^2 - 0.25s^2$
             = $0.75s^2$

**Step 5: Calculate the fraction of the shaded area with respect to the total area of the two squares.**

Total area of the two squares = $2s^2$

Fraction of shaded area = $\frac{0.75s^2}{2s^2} = \frac{3}{8}$.

**Answer**: The fraction of the two squares that is shaded is $\frac{3}{8}$.

To solve this problem, let's start with understanding the properties of an isosceles triangle. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are equal in length and two angles that are equal in measure. In the given triangle \(\triangle XYZ\), \(XY = YZ = 17\) units.

For the given triangle \(\triangle XYZ\):

1. Let \(XY = YZ = 17\) (given).
2. Let the height of the triangle from vertex \(Y\) be \(h\).
3. Using the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle \(WXY\) (where \(W\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(Y\) to side \(XZ\)):
\[h^2 + 15^2 = 17^2\]
\[h^2 = 289 - 225 = 64\]
\[h = 8\]
4. Area of \(\triangle XYZ = \frac{1}{2} \times XZ \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times 8 = 120\).

Now, for the second isosceles triangle with an area of 120:

1. Let the unequal side be \(b\) and the equal sides be \(a\).
2. Let the height of the triangle from the base \(b\) be \(h_2\).
3. Area of the triangle = \(\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h_2 = 120\). ...(i)
4. Using the Pythagorean theorem for one of the right triangles formed by dropping a perpendicular from the apex of the isosceles triangle to the base:
\[h_2^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 = a^2\]. ...(ii)

From equation (i):
\[h_2 = \frac{240}{b}\]

Substituting this value into equation (ii):
\[\left(\frac{240}{b}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 = a^2\]

Now, the perimeter of the triangle = \(2a + b\). The task is to find the integer values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that they satisfy the above equation and the area condition, excluding the given triangle.

With trial and error, and starting with small values for \(b\), you'll find that \(b = 16\) and \(a = 17\) fits our criteria (this is the given triangle, so we ignore it). 

The next fit is \(b = 48\) and \(a = 25\). 

Thus, the perimeter of the second triangle = \(2(25) + 48 = 98\).

So, the perimeter of the second triangle with area 120 is \(98\) units.

1. We start with a square, which has been divided into two equal triangles by the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right.

2. The shaded triangle lies in the top right half of the square. The line that forms the base of the shaded triangle runs from the midpoint of the top edge to the midpoint of the right edge of the square.

3. The area of a triangle is given by:
   \[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

4. Let's consider the side of the square to be \(s\). Therefore, the base and height of the shaded triangle are both \( \frac{s}{2} \) (since they are half the side of the square).

5. The area of the shaded triangle is:
   \[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{s}{2} \times \frac{s}{2} = \frac{1}{8} s^2 \]

6. The total area of the square is:
   \[ \text{Area} = s^2 \]

7. Therefore, the fraction of the square that is shaded is:
   \[ \frac{\text{Area of shaded triangle}}{\text{Total area of square}} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} s^2}{s^2} \]

When we divide \(\frac{1}{8} s^2\) by \(s^2\), we're left with just the fraction \(\frac{1}{8}\).

So, the shaded portion of the square represents \(\frac{1}{8}\) or one-eighth of the total area of the square.

Alright, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Compute the Surface Area of the Cube:**
The surface area of a cube is given by \(6 \times \text{area of one face}\). Since each face of the cube is a square with side length \(s\), the area of one face is \(s^2\).
Thus, the surface area \(SA = 6s^2\).

2. **Compute the Volume of the Cube:**
The volume of a cube is given by \(s \times s \times s = s^3\).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
According to the problem, the surface area of the cube is equal to the sum of its volume and five times its edge length. So we have:
\[6s^2 = s^3 + 5s\]

4. **Rearrange and Solve for \(s\):**
\[s^3 - 6s^2 + 5s = 0\]

We can factor out \(s\) to simplify:
\[s(s^2 - 6s + 5) = 0\]

This means \(s = 0\) or \(s^2 - 6s + 5 = 0\). 

For the quadratic equation \(s^2 - 6s + 5 = 0\), we can factor it further as:
\[(s - 5)(s - 1) = 0\]

So the solutions are \(s = 5\) or \(s = 1\).

Since \(s > 0\) (as given in the problem), we can ignore the solution \(s = 0\).

5. **Compute the Sum of the Possible Values of \(s\):**
So the possible values of \(s\) are \(1\) and \(5\), and their sum is \(1 + 5 = 6\).

**Answer: The sum of all possible values of \(s\) is 6.**
