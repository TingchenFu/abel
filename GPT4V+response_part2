Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

**Step 1:** Understand the properties of midpoints
Given that $N$ is the midpoint of side $AC$ and $M$ is the midpoint of side $BC$, we can deduce that:
$NC = CA/2$
and
$MC = CB/2$

**Step 2:** Use properties of triangles
We're given that the area of $\triangle APN$ is $2\mbox{ cm}^2$. The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

For $\triangle APN$, the base can be taken as $AN$ and the height is $NP$. Thus, the area is:
\[ 2\mbox{ cm}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times AN \times NP \]

**Step 3:** Express the area of $\triangle ABC$ in terms of $\triangle APN$
The area of $\triangle ABC$ can be found using:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \text{Area of } \triangle ACP + \text{Area of } \triangle CBP \]

Since $N$ is the midpoint of $AC$, the height of $\triangle ACP$ will be $2 \times NP$. Similarly, since $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, the base of $\triangle CBP$ will be $2 \times BP$. 

\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ACP = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times (2 \times NP) = AC \times NP \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle CBP = \frac{1}{2} \times (2 \times BP) \times CP = BP \times CP \]

The area of $\triangle ABC$ is thus:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = AC \times NP + BP \times CP \]

**Step 4:** Expressing the area of $\triangle APN$ in terms of given data
From the formula for the area of $\triangle APN$, we can deduce:
\[ NP = \frac{4\mbox{ cm}^2}{AN} \]
Given that $NP = AB/2$ (because $P$ is the midpoint of $AB$), we can express:
\[ AN = 2 \times \frac{4\mbox{ cm}^2}{AB/2} = \frac{8\mbox{ cm}^2}{AB} \]

**Step 5:** Combine the areas
From step 3, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[ AC \times NP + BP \times CP \]
From the area of $\triangle APN$:
\[ NP = \frac{4\mbox{ cm}^2}{AN} \]
And using step 4:
\[ AN = \frac{8\mbox{ cm}^2}{AB} \]

From the above information, we can deduce that the area of $\triangle ACP$ is four times the area of $\triangle APN$, which is $8\mbox{ cm}^2$.

Similarly, since $P$ is the midpoint of $AB$, the area of $\triangle CBP$ is also $8\mbox{ cm}^2$.

Therefore, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[ 8\mbox{ cm}^2 + 8\mbox{ cm}^2 = 16\mbox{ cm}^2 \]

So, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is \( 16\mbox{ cm}^2 \).

Alright, let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the Circumference of the Circle**:
The circumference \( C \) of a circle with radius \( r \) is given by:
\[ C = 2\pi r \]
For a circle with radius \( r = 12 \) units, the circumference is:
\[ C = 2\pi \times 12 = 24\pi \]
units.

2. **Determine the Length of the Arc**:
The length of an arc in a sector of a circle can be found using the formula:
\[ \text{Arc Length} = \left( \frac{\text{Angle}}{360^\circ} \right) \times C \]
Here, the angle is \( 60^\circ \), so the arc length is:
\[ \text{Arc Length} = \left( \frac{60}{360} \right) \times 24\pi \]
\[ \text{Arc Length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24\pi \]
\[ \text{Arc Length} = 4\pi \]
units.

3. **Determine the Perimeter of the Sector**:
The perimeter of the sector is the sum of the lengths of the two radii and the arc length. Since the radius is 12 units, and there are two of them, their combined length is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) units. 
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 24 + 4\pi \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 24 + 4(3.14159) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} \approx 24 + 12.566 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} \approx 36.566 \]
units.

So, the perimeter of the sector of the circle with radius 12 and a central angle of \( 60^\circ \) is approximately \( 36.566 \) units.

To find the area of the triangle formed by the three lines, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

We'll treat the vertical line \( x = -2 \) as the base of the triangle.

1. **Determine the Base of the Triangle**:
The base of the triangle (on the line \( x = -2 \)) extends from the intersection of \( x = -2 \) and \( y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 \) to the intersection of \( x = -2 \) and \( y = -2x + 8 \).

First, we'll find the y-coordinate of the point where the line \( x = -2 \) intersects \( y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 \):
\[ y = \frac{1}{2}(-2) - 2 \]
\[ y = -1 - 2 \]
\[ y = -3 \]
So, one point of intersection is (-2, -3).

Next, we'll find the y-coordinate of the point where the line \( x = -2 \) intersects \( y = -2x + 8 \):
\[ y = -2(-2) + 8 \]
\[ y = 4 + 8 \]
\[ y = 12 \]
So, the other point of intersection is (-2, 12).

2. **Calculate the Height of the Triangle**:
The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from the line \( x = -2 \) to the point (4,0), which is the intersection of the lines \( y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 \) and \( y = -2x + 8 \). 
This distance is \( 4 - (-2) = 6 \) units.

3. **Calculate the Length of the Base**:
The length of the base of the triangle is the vertical distance between the points (-2, -3) and (-2, 12), which is \( 12 - (-3) = 15 \) units.

4. **Plug the values into the formula**:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 90 \]
\[ \text{Area} = 45 \] square units.

So, the area of the triangle formed by the lines \( y = -2x + 8 \), \( y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 \), and \( x = -2 \) is \( 45 \) square units.

2. Since \( AED \) is an equilateral triangle, all of its angles are equal, and each is \( 60^\circ \). So, angle \( DAE \) is \( 60^\circ \).

3. To find the measure of angle \( BAE \), we will subtract the measure of angle \( DAE \) from the measure of angle \( BAD \):
\[ BAD - DAE = BAE \]

To solve this problem, we will use the properties of triangles and parallelograms. 

**Step 1:** Observe that since \(\overline{AB}\|\overline{DE}\), \(ABCD\) forms a parallelogram. Therefore, opposite sides of the parallelogram are equal in length, so \(AB = CD\). 

**Step 2:** It's given that \(BD = 4BC\). We know that the height of both \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle CDE\) from base \(BC\) and \(CD\) respectively is the same (since they share the height inside the parallelogram \(ABCD\)). Therefore, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\), to relate the areas of the two triangles.

**Step 3:** Set up an equation using the ratio of the bases and the known area of \(\triangle ABC\):

Given, \(Area(\triangle ABC) = 6\).
Since \(BD = 4BC\), and \(CD = AB\), \(CD = \frac{1}{4}BD\). This means that \(BC = \frac{1}{4}CD\).

Using the formula for the area of a triangle, we know:
\[Area(\triangle ABC) = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h\]
\[Area(\triangle CDE) = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times h\]

Using the relationship \(BC = \frac{1}{4}CD\), we can say:
\[Area(\triangle ABC) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}CD \times h = \frac{1}{8}CDh\]

But we know that \(Area(\triangle ABC) = 6\):
\[6 = \frac{1}{8}CDh\]
Equation (1)

For \(\triangle CDE\):
\[Area(\triangle CDE) = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times h = CDh\]
Equation (2)

**Step 4:** Using the equations (1) and (2) and the fact that \(CDh = 8 \times 6 = 48\), we find that the area of \(\triangle CDE\) is \(48\) square centimeters.

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle CDE\) is \(48\) square centimeters.

Alright! Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

First, observe that the hexagon has been divided into a smaller hexagon and a surrounding "ring" of triangles and parallelograms.

## Step 1: Establish a Base Unit

By inspection, the simplest region to start with is the smallest triangle formed by the intersection of two non-adjacent vertices with the center of the hexagon. There are 6 of these triangles in total.

Looking at the given coordinates for the vertices of the hexagon, we can deduce that the side length of this hexagon is 1 unit.

Now, considering one of the smaller triangles (e.g., the triangle formed by vertices (0,0), (1,1), and the midpoint of the segment joining (0,0) and (1,0)), we see that its base has length 0.5 units and its height is also 0.5 units. Thus, the area of this triangle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.125 \]

So, our base unit for area, which we'll call \(a\), is 0.125.

## Step 2: Compute the Area of Larger Regions

We can compute the area of other regions by adding or subtracting our base unit triangle.

For instance, the parallelogram in the "ring" can be visualized as being composed of 4 of our base unit triangles. Therefore, the area of this parallelogram is \(4a = 4 \times 0.125 = 0.5\).

The larger triangle in the "ring" (e.g., the triangle with vertices (0,0), (2,1), and the midpoint of the segment joining (0,0) and (1,0)) can be seen as being composed of 3 of our base unit triangles. Its area is therefore \(3a = 3 \times 0.125 = 0.375\).

## Step 3: Finding the Smallest and Largest Regions

From our computations:
- The smallest region is one of the base unit triangles with area 0.125.
- The largest region is the inner hexagon. To find its area, note that it's composed of 6 parallelograms and a smaller hexagon. The area of 6 parallelograms is \(6 \times 0.5 = 3\). The area of the smaller hexagon is the total area of the large hexagon minus the area of the "ring". The area of the "ring" is \(6 \times 0.375 + 12 \times 0.125 = 2.25 + 1.5 = 3.75\). Therefore, the area of the larger hexagon is \(6\), and the area of the inner hexagon is \(6 - 3.75 = 2.25\).

Therefore, the ratio of the smallest region to the largest is:

\[ \frac{0.125}{2.25} = \frac{1}{18} \]

So, the answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{18}}\).

Alright, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Finding the Radius of the Semicircle**:
   - Given that the area of the semicircle is \(2\pi\), the area of the full circle would be \(4\pi\).
   - Let's call the radius of the circle \(r\). The formula for the area of a circle is \(\pi r^2\). Equating this to \(4\pi\), we get:
     \(\pi r^2 = 4\pi\)
     \(r^2 = 4\)
     \(r = 2\)

   So, the radius \(r\) of the circle is 2 units.

2. **Finding the Hypotenuse AB of Triangle ABC**:
   - Since the circle is tangent to sides \(AC\) and \(BC\), we know that the distance from the center \(O\) of the circle to each of these sides is also \(r\). This is because a radius drawn perpendicular to a tangent touches the circle at a right angle.
   - Given the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, sides \(AC\) and \(BC\) are equal.
   - The hypotenuse \(AB\) can be divided into two segments, from \(A\) to the point where the circle touches the hypotenuse, and from \(B\) to that same point. Each of these segments is the radius of the circle, which is 2 units.
   - So, the hypotenuse \(AB\) is \(2 + 2 = 4\) units.

3. **Finding the Area of Triangle ABC**:
   - In an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are of equal length. If the hypotenuse is \(h\), then each leg is \(\frac{h}{\sqrt{2}}\). In this case, the hypotenuse \(AB\) is 4 units, so each leg (sides \(AC\) and \(BC\)) is \(\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}\), which simplifies to \(2\sqrt{2}\) units.
   - The area \(A\) of a right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\) is \(\frac{1}{2}ab\). 
     \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times 2\sqrt{2} \times 2\sqrt{2}\)
     \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4\)

\[V_{cylinder} = \pi r^2 h\]
where \(r\) is the radius of the cylinder and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

From the problem, we have:
\[ \pi r^2 h = 72\pi\]

**Step 2:** From the diagram, we observe that the height of the cone is the same as the height of the cylinder, \(h\). Additionally, the radius of the base of the cone is also the same as the radius of the cylinder, \(r\).

The volume \(V_{cone}\) of the cone is given by:
\[V_{cone} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\]

**Step 3:** To find the volume of the space inside the cylinder but outside the cone, subtract the volume of the cone from the volume of the cylinder:
\[V_{space} = V_{cylinder} - V_{cone}\]
\[V_{space} = \pi r^2 h - \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\]
\[V_{space} = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^2 h\]

**Step 4:** Substitute the given volume of the cylinder into the expression for \(V_{space}\):
\[V_{space} = \frac{2}{3} \times 72\pi = 48\pi\]

Thus, the number of cubic centimeters in the space inside the cylinder but outside the cone is \(48\pi\) cubic centimeters.

4. Now, to find \( \angle AXC \):
Since the total internal angles in a triangle add up to \( 180^\circ \):

**Step 2:** Let's find the area of triangles $STR$ and $RWS$.

Using similar reasoning as in step 1, we conclude that the area of each triangle, $STR$ and $RWS$, is $0.5$.

**Step 3:** Compute the area of triangle $UVW$.

Notice that $\triangle UVW$ is similar to $\triangle PQR$ and $\triangle STU$ since they are all equilateral triangles. Since $UV$ and $UW$ are half the length of $PQ$ and $PU$, respectively, the area of $\triangle UVW$ is $\frac{1}{4}$ of the area of $\triangle PQR$ or $\triangle STU$. Therefore, the area of $\triangle UVW$ is $\frac{1}{4} \times 1 = 0.25$.

**Step 4:** Compute the area of parallelogram $UVRW$.

To find the area of parallelogram $UVRW$, we can add up the areas of the triangles we've found and subtract the area of triangle $UVW$:

Area of $UVRW$ = (Area of $PQV$ + Area of $QUS$ + Area of $STR$ + Area of $RWS$) - Area of $UVW$ 

Area of $UVRW$ = ($0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5$) - $0.25$ = $2 - 0.25 = 1.75$.

Since \(ABDC\) and \(EFHG\) are squares,

\[HG = EF = 1\]

The length of the diagonal \(AY\) is the sum of \(AC\) and \(CY\).

Similarly, 
\[SH = SF + FH\]
\[5 = SF + 1\]
\[SF = 4\]

**Step 2**: Finding the lengths of \(DE\) and \(YS\).

Since \(ABDC\) and \(EFHG\) are squares, their diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Thus, triangles \(ADC\) and \(EFH\) are 45-45-90 triangles. 

For a 45-45-90 triangle, if the legs have a length \(x\), then the hypotenuse has a length \(x\sqrt{2}\).

So, the diagonal of square \(ABDC\) (i.e., \(AC\)) has a length 
\[AC = AB \times \sqrt{2} = 1 \times \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}\]

Similarly, the diagonal of square \(EFHG\) (i.e., \(EH\)) has a length

3. Area of each \(10''\) by \(12''\) face:
\[ A_3 = 10'' \times 12'' = 120''^2 \]
Since there are 2 such faces, total area = \( 2 \times 120''^2 = 240''^2 \)

Since \(PQRST\) is a regular pentagon, all its interior angles are equal. The sum of the interior angles of any polygon is given by \(180(n-2)\) degrees, where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \(n = 5\). Thus, the sum of its interior angles is \(180(5-2) = 540\) degrees. Therefore, each interior angle of a regular pentagon is \(\frac{540}{5} = 108\) degrees.

Step 2: Break down angle \(XQS\)
We can find angle \(XQS\) by summing angles \(XQT\) and \(TQS\).

Angle \(TQS\) is half of one of the angles of the regular pentagon (since \(X\) is the midpoint of \(ST\)). Therefore, \(TQS = \frac{108}{2} = 54\) degrees.

Angle \(XQT\) is an exterior angle at vertex \(T\) of the pentagon. The exterior angle of a regular polygon is \(\frac{360}{n}\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, this becomes \(\frac{360}{5} = 72\) degrees.

Step 3: Sum the angles
Adding angles \(TQS\) and \(XQT\), we have:

\(XQS = 54 + 72 = 126\) degrees.

Thus, the measure of angle \(XQS\) is \(126\) degrees.

Alright, let's solve this step by step.

**Step 1:** Begin by determining the side length of the equilateral triangle, \(BEF\).

Since \(BEF\) is equilateral, \(EF = BE = BD\). We know that \(BD\) (the diagonal of the square) is \(\sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2}\). Since \(AB\) and \(AD\) are both sides of a square, they are equal. Let's say the side of the square is \(s\). Therefore, \(BD = \sqrt{s^2 + s^2} = \sqrt{2s^2} = s\sqrt{2}\). Hence, \(EF = BE = s\sqrt{2}\).

**Step 2:** Determine the height of triangle \(DEF\).

The height of triangle \(DEF\) from base \(EF\) can be found by subtracting the height of triangle \(BEF\) from side \(AD\) of the square.

The height of the equilateral triangle \(BEF\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Since we know \(EF = s\sqrt{2}\) and \(BF = \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}\) (half of the base), the height \(BH\) (from \(B\) perpendicular to \(EF\)) is:

\[BH^2 + BF^2 = BE^2\]
\[BH^2 + \left(\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = (s\sqrt{2})^2\]
\[BH^2 = 2s^2 - \frac{s^2}{2}\]
\[BH = \frac{s\sqrt{6}}{2}\]

Now, the height of triangle \(DEF\) from base \(EF\) is:
\[DH = AD - BH = s - \frac{s\sqrt{6}}{2}\]

**Step 3:** Find the areas of triangles \(DEF\) and \(ABE\).

The area of triangle \(DEF\):
\[Area_{DEF} = \frac{1}{2} \times EF \times DH = \frac{1}{2} \times s\sqrt{2} \times \left(s - \frac{s\sqrt{6}}{2}\right)\]

The area of triangle \(ABE\):
\[Area_{ABE} = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times BE\]
Given that \(BE = s\sqrt{2}\), this becomes:
\[Area_{ABE} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times s\sqrt{2} = \frac{s^2\sqrt{2}}{2}\]

**Step 4:** Determine the ratio of the areas of triangles \(DEF\) and \(ABE\).

Using the formulas derived above:
\[Ratio = \frac{Area_{DEF}}{Area_{ABE}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \times s\sqrt{2} \times \left(s - \frac{s\sqrt{6}}{2}\right)}{\frac{s^2\sqrt{2}}{2}}\]

By simplifying the above equation:
\[Ratio = \frac{s \times \left(s - \frac{s\sqrt{6}}{2}\right)}{s^2}\]
\[Ratio = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\]

Thus, the ratio of the area of \(DEF\) to that of \(ABE\) is \(1 - \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\).

\[ \frac{9\pi}{2} + 8\pi = \frac{25\pi}{2} \]
So, the combined area of the two smaller semicircles is \( \frac{25\pi}{2} \).

Now, subtract the area of the triangle and the shaded semicircle from the combined area of the two smaller semicircles to get the total area of the two crescent-shaped regions:
\[ \frac{25\pi}{2} - 24 - \frac{25\pi}{2} = -24 \]

However, this doesn't make sense as the area can't be negative. It appears there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation.

**Correction**:
To find the area of the two crescent-shaped regions, subtract the area of the triangle from the combined area of the two smaller semicircles:
\[ \frac{25\pi}{2} - 24 = \frac{25\pi - 48}{2} \]

This gives us the area of the two crescent-shaped regions as:
\[ \frac{25\pi - 48}{2} \]

That's your answer.

Alright! Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Diagram

The diagram shows two similar triangles. One is nested inside the other. Both have parallel bases. The height of the smaller triangle is 4 cm and the distance between the parallel bases (which is also the difference in heights between the two triangles) is 10 cm.

### Step 2: Calculating the Heights

We know the height of the smaller triangle is 4 cm. Since the distance between the parallel bases is 10 cm, the height of the larger triangle will be \(4 cm + 10 cm = 14 cm\).

### Step 3: Using the Formula for the Area of a Triangle

The area of a triangle is given by the formula: 
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Since both triangles are similar and have the same base, the ratio of their areas will be based solely on the ratio of their heights squared.

\[ \text{Area ratio} = \left(\frac{\text{height of smaller triangle}}{\text{height of larger triangle}}\right)^2 \]

### Step 4: Plugging in the Heights

\[ \text{Area ratio} = \left(\frac{4 cm}{14 cm}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{7}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{49} \]

So, the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle is \(\boxed{\frac{4}{49}}\).

Alright, let's solve this step by step:

**Step 1:** Identify the type of triangles.

Both triangles are similar because they have the same shape (they are scaled versions of each other). This is evident from the fact that the bases are parallel and the angles are the same.

**Step 2:** Recall the relationship between similar triangles' sides and their areas.

The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

**Step 3:** Determine the ratio of the sides of the two triangles.

Given that one base is 4 cm and the other base (for the larger triangle) is 10 cm, the ratio of the sides of the two triangles is:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{side of smaller triangle}}{\text{side of larger triangle}} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5} \]

**Step 4:** Find the ratio of the areas of the two triangles.

Using the relationship from Step 2:
\[ \text{Area Ratio} = (\text{Side Ratio})^2 = \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{25} \]

Thus, the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle is \( \frac{4}{25} \).

Alright, let's solve this step by step.

**Step 1:** Determine the radius of the circumcircle of triangle \( ABC \).

The circumcenter, \( O \), is the center of the circumcircle of triangle \( ABC \). Since \( AB \) is a chord of the circumcircle, the perpendicular bisector of \( AB \) passes through \( O \). Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of \( AC \) also passes through \( O \). The intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors is \( O \). Since \( AB = AC \), triangle \( ABC \) is isosceles and the altitude from \( A \) to \( BC \) bisects \( BC \) and is also a perpendicular bisector of \( AC \). Thus, \( AO \) is the altitude from \( A \) to \( BC \).

We can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle \( ABO \) or \( ACO \) to find \( AO \). Let \( BO \) be \( r \) (which is the radius of the circumcircle). Then,
\[ AO^2 + 3^2 = r^2 \]
\[ AO = \sqrt{r^2 - 9} \]

Using the area of triangle \( ABC \) in two different ways:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot AO = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 15 \]
Substituting for \( AO \):
\[ 3 \sqrt{r^2 - 9} = 15 \]
\[ \sqrt{r^2 - 9} = 5 \]
\[ r^2 = 34 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{34} \]

**Step 2:** Determine the height of triangle \( OBC \) from base \( BC \).

Since \( O \) is the circumcenter and \( BC \) is a chord of the circumcircle, the perpendicular from \( O \) to \( BC \) bisects \( BC \). Thus, \( OC = OB = \sqrt{34} \).

Now, in right triangle \( OCB \),
\[ OC^2 = OB^2 = OX^2 + BX^2 \]
Where \( OX \) is the height from \( O \) to \( BC \). Given \( BX = 3 \) (because \( BX \) is half of \( BC \)),
\[ \sqrt{34}^2 = OX^2 + 3^2 \]
\[ 34 = OX^2 + 9 \]
\[ OX^2 = 25 \]
\[ OX = 5 \]

**Step 3:** Find the area of triangle \( OBC \).

\[ \text{Area of } OBC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times OX = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 5 = 15 \]

So, the area of triangle \( OBC \) is \( 15 \) square units.

Alright, let's solve this problem step by step.

Given that \(\angle A=\angle B\), we can conclude that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AC = BC.

Step 1: Use the property of an isosceles triangle.
In an isosceles triangle, the sides opposite the congruent angles are congruent. So, AC = BC.

Given that,
AC = \(3x - 1\)
BC = \(x + 4\)

Setting them equal to each other:
\(3x - 1 = x + 4\)

Step 2: Solve for x.
Subtracting x from both sides:
\(2x - 1 = 4\)

Now, adding 1 to both sides:
\(2x = 5\)

Divide both sides by 2:
\[x = \frac{5}{2}\]

Which is equivalent to:
\[x = 2.5\]

So, \(x = 2.5\).

Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step.

1. **Identifying the Geometry**
From the diagram, we can infer that the square's side (let's call it \( s \)) is made up of the diameter of the small circle (which is 2 units, since the radius is 1) plus twice the radius of the big circle (which is 4 units, since the radius is 2). So, 
\[ s = 2 + 4 = 6 \]

2. **Understanding the Distance**
The distance from the center of the small circle to the corner of the square is the diagonal of the square minus the radius of the big circle. 
Using the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle formed by half of the side of the square and the diagonal, we get:
\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{s^2 + s^2} \]
\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{2} \times s \]
Given \( s = 6 \), the diagonal is:
\[ \text{Diagonal} = 6\sqrt{2} \]
Now, the distance from the center of the small circle to the corner of the square is:
\[ 6\sqrt{2} - 2 = 4\sqrt{2} \]

3. **Using Tangent Circles**
The line from the center of the big circle to the center of the small circle is perpendicular to the side of the square because the two circles are tangent to the square's side. 
Thus, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ \text{Radius of small circle}^2 + \text{Distance from the center of the small circle to the corner of the square}^2 = \text{Radius of big circle}^2 \]
Substitute in the known values:
\[ 1^2 + (4\sqrt{2})^2 = 2^2 \]
\[ 1 + 32 = 4 \]
\[ 33 = 4 \]
This is obviously not true, so there seems to be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's correct it.

The error in the reasoning was assuming that the entire side of the square is made up of the diameter of the small circle plus twice the radius of the big circle. Actually, there are two small circles and one big circle involved. So:

4. **Corrected Calculation for Side of Square**
The side \( s \) of the square is made up of the diameters of two small circles plus the diameter of the large circle:
\[ s = 2(1) + 2(1) + 2(2) \]
\[ s = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 \]

5. **Area of the Square**
The area \( A \) of the square is:
\[ A = s^2 \]
\[ A = 8^2 = 64 \]

So, the area of the square is \( 64 \) square units.

Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Understand the figure.**
We have a regular hexagon with all sides of length 4 inches. Two equilateral triangles are formed by joining alternate vertices. The region common to the two triangles is a smaller regular hexagon. We need to find the area of this smaller hexagon.

**Step 2: Find the side length of the smaller hexagon.**
To determine the side length of the smaller hexagon, let's find the height of one of the equilateral triangles formed. 

Consider one of the equilateral triangles with side length 4 inches. Its height (h) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Half of the base of this triangle is 2 inches, and using it as one leg of a right triangle, we get:

\[ h^2 + 2^2 = 4^2 \]
\[ h^2 = 16 - 4 \]
\[ h^2 = 12 \]
\[ h = \sqrt{12} \]
\[ h = 2\sqrt{3} \]

Since the hexagon is regular, the height of the equilateral triangle is equal to the distance between two parallel sides of the hexagon. This means that the side length of the smaller hexagon is:

\[ 4 - 2\sqrt{3} \]

**Step 3: Find the area of the smaller hexagon.**
To find the area of the smaller hexagon, we can break it into 6 congruent equilateral triangles and find the area of one such triangle.

Area of an equilateral triangle = \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times \text{side}^2\)

Using the side length \(4 - 2\sqrt{3}\) inches, the area of one triangle is:

\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (4 - 2\sqrt{3})^2 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (16 - 16\sqrt{3} + 12) \]
\[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 28 \]
\[ = 7\sqrt{3} \]

Since the hexagon is made up of 6 such triangles, the total area is:

\[ 6 \times 7\sqrt{3} \]
\[ = 42\sqrt{3} \]

So, the area of the region that is common to the two triangles is \(42\sqrt{3}\) square inches.

Certainly! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. **Identifying the Relationship Between the Circumference and the Radius**:
   - The circumference \(C\) of a circle with radius \(r\) is given by:
     \[C = 2\pi r\]

2. **Finding the Radius of Earth**:
   - Given the Earth's equator has a circumference of 25,100 miles, and using the formula for the circumference, we can find the radius \(R\) of the Earth.
     \[25,100 = 2\pi R\]
     Dividing both sides by \(2\pi\):
     \[R \approx \frac{25,100}{2\pi} \approx 3,982.45 \text{ miles}\]
   - So, the Earth's radius is approximately 3,982.45 miles.

3. **Identifying the Radius of the Circle Through Lena**:
   - We know that Lena is located at \(45^{\circ}\) North Latitude. This means it's halfway between the equator and the North Pole. If we imagine a line (radius of the circle) going from the center of the Earth to Lena, this line will form a \(45^{\circ}\) angle with the Earth's radius (which is a line from the Earth's center to a point on the equator). 
   - Now, if we consider the Earth's center, the point on the equator, and Lena, they form a right triangle. Using trigonometry, the length of the segment from the Earth's center to the circle through Lena (i.e., the circle's radius \(r\)) will be:
     \[r = R \cdot \cos(45^{\circ})\]
     \(R\) is the Earth's radius, which we found to be approximately 3,982.45 miles.
     Given that \(\cos(45^{\circ}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\):
     \[r \approx 3,982.45 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 2,817.36 \text{ miles}\]
   - So, the radius of the circle through Lena is approximately 2,817.36 miles.

4. **Calculating the Circumference of the Circle Through Lena**:
   - Using the formula for the circumference and the radius we found for the circle through Lena:
     \[C = 2\pi r\]
     \[C \approx 2\pi \cdot 2,817.36 \approx 17,683.51\]
   - So, the circumference is approximately 17,683.51 miles.

Rounding to the nearest hundred miles, the circumference of the circle on Earth parallel to the equator and through Lena, Wisconsin, is approximately 17,700 miles.

To determine the perimeter of the trapezoid, we first need to find the lengths of the two slanted sides.

Let's call the length of the unknown base \( b \) cm. We are given that the trapezoid's area is \( 162 \) cm\(^2\). The formula for the area of a trapezoid is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{height} \times (\text{base}_1 + \text{base}_2) \]
where:
\(\text{height} = 12 \) cm
\(\text{base}_1 = 16 \) cm
\(\text{base}_2 = b \) cm

Substituting the given values into the formula:
\[ 162 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times (16 + b) \]

Expanding and solving for \( b \):
\[ 162 = 6(16 + b) \]
\[ 162 = 96 + 6b \]
\[ 66 = 6b \]
\[ b = 11 \]

So, the length of the unknown base is \( 11 \) cm.

Now, we need to determine the lengths of the slanted sides of the trapezoid. For this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. If we drop a perpendicular from the top right vertex to the bottom base, we would form two right triangles. Let's focus on the right triangle on the right side of the trapezoid.

The height of this triangle is \( 12 \) cm. The base of this triangle (the segment of the bottom base of the trapezoid from the perpendicular to the rightmost vertex) is \( 16 - 11 = 5 \) cm.

Let's call the length of the slanted side \( s \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ s^2 = 12^2 + 5^2 \]
\[ s^2 = 144 + 25 \]
\[ s^2 = 169 \]
\[ s = 13 \]

So, each slanted side is \( 13 \) cm long.

Now, to find the perimeter of the trapezoid, simply add up all the side lengths:
\[ 16 \text{ cm} + 11 \text{ cm} + 13 \text{ cm} + 13 \text{ cm} = 53 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the trapezoid is \( 53 \) cm.

Now, let's examine triangle \(ABC\). 

1. Let the side of the square be \(s\). Thus, the area of the square inscribed in triangle \(ABC\) is \(s^2\). We're given this area is 15 square centimeters, so \(s^2 = 15\). Taking the square root of both sides, we get \(s = \sqrt{15}\).
  
2. The two triangles formed by removing the square from triangle \(ABC\) are also isosceles right triangles. Let's call one of these triangles \(ABC_1\). The base of \(ABC_1\) is the side of the square, which is \(s = \sqrt{15}\), and the height of \(ABC_1\) is the remaining portion of triangle \(ABC\). 

Given that triangle \(ABC_1\) is an isosceles right triangle, the height is also \(s = \sqrt{15}\).

3. The length of side \(AB\) (or \(BC\)) of the triangle \(ABC\) is thus \(2 \times \sqrt{15}\).

Since triangles \(ABC\) and \(DEF\) are congruent, the length of side \(DE\) (or \(EF\)) of triangle \(DEF\) is also \(2 \times \sqrt{15}\).

4. For triangle \(DEF\), let's call the side of the inscribed square \(t\). The length of side \(DE\) minus twice the side of the square gives the height of the two smaller triangles that are created by the inscribed square in triangle \(DEF\), i.e., \(2 \times \sqrt{15} - 2t\).

Since the smaller triangles formed are also isosceles right triangles, the base of these triangles will also be \(2 \times \sqrt{15} - 2t\).

5. Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle formed by half the square and the smaller triangle:

\[ t^2 + (2 \times \sqrt{15} - 2t)^2 = (2 \times \sqrt{15})^2 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ t^2 + 4 \times 15 - 8t \times \sqrt{15} + 4t^2 = 60 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 5t^2 - 8t \times \sqrt{15} = 0 \]

Factoring out the common term:

\[ t(5t - 8 \sqrt{15}) = 0 \]

Since \(t\) cannot be 0, we get:

\[ 5t = 8 \sqrt{15} \]
\[ t = \frac{8 \sqrt{15}}{5} \]
\[ t = \frac{8 \times \sqrt{15} \times \sqrt{5}}{5 \times 5} \]
\[ t = \frac{8 \times \sqrt{75}}{25} \]
\[ t = \frac{24}{5} \]
\[ t = 4.8 \]

So, the side length of the square inscribed in triangle \(DEF\) is 4.8 centimeters.

6. The area of the square inscribed in triangle \(DEF\) is:

\[ t^2 = (4.8)^2 = 23.04 \]

Thus, the area of the square inscribed in triangle \(DEF\) is \(23.04\) square centimeters.

Given that \( HC = 150 \) m and \( HD = 130 \) m, and that \( OD = 140 \) m, we can calculate the heights \( AO \) and \( BO \).

Using triangle \( HOD \):
\[ AO^2 + OD^2 = HD^2 \]
\[ AO^2 + 140^2 = 130^2 \]
\[ AO^2 = 130^2 - 140^2 \]
\[ AO^2 = 6900 - 19600 \]
\[ AO^2 = -12700 \]
This is impossible since squares of real numbers can't be negative. This means that point D lies between O and H on the line segment OH.

Using triangle \( HOC \):
\[ AO^2 + OD^2 = HC^2 \]
\[ AO^2 + 140^2 = 150^2 \]
\[ AO^2 = 150^2 - 140^2 \]
\[ AO^2 = 22500 - 19600 \]
\[ AO^2 = 2900 \]
\[ AO = 53.85 \] m (rounded to two decimal places).

Now, we know \( OC = AO \) since they are vertical opposite angles and are equal, so \( OC = 53.85 \) m. Thus, \( BO = 53.85 \) m.

Let the distance from C to point P be \( x \). Therefore, the distance from D to point P will be \( 140 - x \).

For triangle \( HPC \):
\[ \frac{HP}{x} = \frac{HC}{OC} \]
\[ HP = \frac{HC \cdot x}{OC} \]
\[ HP = \frac{150x}{53.85} \]

For triangle \( HPD \):
\[ \frac{HP}{140-x} = \frac{HD}{OD} \]
\[ HP = \frac{HD \cdot (140-x)}{OD} \]
\[ HP = \frac{130(140-x)}{140} \]

Equating the two expressions for \( HP \):
\[ \frac{150x}{53.85} = \frac{130(140-x)}{140} \]

3. **Solve for x:**
Expanding and solving for \( x \), you will get \( x \approx 84.09 \) m (rounded to two decimal places).

4. **Determine the length saved:**
The length saved will be:
\[ HC + HD - HP \]
Using the calculated \( x \) value, plug into one of the \( HP \) expressions to get the length of \( HP \). Subtracting that from \( HC + HD \), you will get the maximum length saved.

After solving, you'll find that the greatest length of rope that can be saved is approximately \( 62.24 \) m (rounded to two decimal places).

Alright, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify given information.

Step 2: Use properties of the circle.
Since $O$ is the center of the circle and both $OA$ and $OB$ are radii, we know that $OA = OB$. This means triangle $OAB$ is isosceles with $\angle OAB = \angle OBA$.

Step 3: Calculate the measure of $\angle OCA$.
Since the sum of the angles in a triangle equals $180^\circ$, in triangle $OAC$, we can find $\angle OCA$:
\[ \angle OCA = 180^\circ - \angle OAC - \angle AOC \]
\[ \angle OCA = 180^\circ - 18^\circ - 90^\circ = 72^\circ \]

Step 4: Use the property that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
Since $AC = BC$, the arcs $AB$ and $BC$ are also equal. Thus, the inscribed angle $\angle ACB$ intercepts arc $AB$, and so:
\[ \angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{arc } AB \]

Step 5: Set up an equation for $\angle AOB$.
Using the fact that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc:
\[ \angle AOB = \text{arc } AB \]
Given that $\angle ACB$ is half the measure of arc $AB$:
\[ \angle ACB = 180^\circ - 72^\circ - 72^\circ = 36^\circ \]
Thus:
\[ \text{arc } AB = 2 \times 36^\circ = 72^\circ \]

\[m \angle ADB = 180^{\circ} - (m \angle ABD + m \angle BAD)\]
\[m \angle ADB = 180^{\circ} - (30^{\circ} + m \angle BAD)\]
Now, we don't know the measure of angle $BAD$ yet, so let's move on to the next step.

2. We're given $m \angle CBD = 80^{\circ}$, and since $AB = BC$, triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, meaning $\angle CAB = \angle CBA$. Using this, we can find:
\[m \angle CAB = \frac{180^{\circ} - m \angle C}{2}\]
\[m \angle CAB = \frac{180^{\circ} - 50^{\circ}}{2} = 65^{\circ}\]

3. Since the total internal angles of a triangle is $180^{\circ}$, for triangle $ABD$ we have:
\[m \angle BAD = 180^{\circ} - (m \angle ABD + m \angle ADB)\]
\[m \angle BAD = 180^{\circ} - (30^{\circ} + 80^{\circ}) = 70^{\circ}\]

4. Finally, using the exterior angle theorem, the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of its two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, for triangle $ABC$, the exterior angle at $A$ is:
\[m \angle CAD = m \angle C + m \angle CAB\]
\[m \angle CAD = 50^{\circ} + 65^{\circ} = 115^{\circ}\]

5. Now, $m \angle CAD = 180^{\circ} - m \angle A$, so:
\[m \angle A = 180^{\circ} - 115^{\circ} = 65^{\circ}\]

So, the measure of angle $A$ is \(65^{\circ}\).

\[ \frac{OT_1}{OT_2} = \frac{O_1Q}{O_2Q} \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5 - a}{11 - a} \]

Solving this equation for \( a \):
\[ 2(5 - a) = 11 - a \]
\[ 10 - 2a = 11 - a \]
\[ a = 1 \]

So, the value of \( a \) is \( 1 \).

To find the area of pentagon \(CDEFG\), we'll break it down into simpler geometric shapes: triangles and rectangles.

1. **Find the Area of \(\triangle CHF\):**

Given that \(CH = 24\) cm and \(HF = 12\) cm, the area of a right triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).

Area of \(\triangle CHF = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 24 = 144\) square cm.

2. **Find the Area of Rectangle \(DEGF\):**

Given that \(DE = GF\) and \(HF = 12\) cm and \(FB = 6\) cm, the length \(DE = HF - FB = 12 - 6 = 6\) cm.

The width of the rectangle is \(DF\), which is equal to the base of the isosceles triangle \(AB\), minus twice the length \(FB\). Since triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles and \(CH\) is an altitude, it bisects the base \(AB\). This means that \(HA = HB = \frac{1}{2} AB\). Given that \(FB = 6\) cm and \(HF = 12\) cm, \(HA = HF + FB = 18\) cm. So, \(AB = 2 \times 18 = 36\) cm. Thus, \(DF = AB - 2 \times FB = 36 - 12 = 24\) cm.

Area of rectangle \(DEGF = 6 \times 24 = 144\) square cm.

3. **Find the Area of \(\triangle CGF\):**

To find the area of \(\triangle CGF\), we need its height from \(G\) to \(AB\). This height is equal to the altitude \(CH\) minus the height of rectangle \(DEGF\), which is \(6\) cm. Therefore, the height from \(G\) to \(AB\) is \(24 - 6 = 18\) cm.

The base of \(\triangle CGF\) is \(GF\), which is the same as \(DE\), so \(GF = 6\) cm.

Area of \(\triangle CGF = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 18 = 54\) square cm.

4. **Add up the Areas to Get the Area of Pentagon \(CDEFG\):**

Area of \(CDEFG = \text{Area of } \triangle CHF + \text{Area of rectangle } DEGF + \text{Area of } \triangle CGF\)

Area of \(CDEFG = 144 + 144 + 54 = 342\) square cm.

Thus, the area of pentagon \(CDEFG\) is \(342\) square centimeters.

Alright, let's solve this step by step:

**Step 1: Understand the Question**
Given that \(\overline{AB} \| \overline{CD}\), the line segment AB is parallel to CD. We also know that \(\overline{AD}\) is a diameter of the circle. The goal is to find the length of arc \(\widehat{AB}\).

**Step 2: Utilize the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
Recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Since \(\angle DAB = 50^\circ\), arc \(\widehat{DB}\) has a measure of \(2 \times 50^\circ = 100^\circ\).

**Step 3: Arc Length**
The circumference \(C\) of a circle is given by \(C = 2\pi r\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle. Since \(AD\) is a diameter, \(r = \frac{AD}{2} = 18^{\prime \prime}\) (where \(^{\prime \prime}\) stands for inches). 
Therefore, the circumference of the circle is:
\[ C = 2\pi \times 18^{\prime \prime} = 36\pi^{\prime \prime} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the Length of \(\widehat{AB}\)**
The arc length of \(\widehat{AB}\) is proportional to its central angle relative to the total \(360^\circ\) of the circle:
\[ \text{Arc length of } \widehat{AB} = \left( \frac{100^\circ}{360^\circ} \right) \times 36\pi^{\prime \prime} = \frac{5}{18} \times 36\pi^{\prime \prime} = 10\pi^{\prime \prime} \]

**Answer:** The length of arc \(\widehat{AB}\) is \(10\pi^{\prime \prime}\).

To find the area of the shaded region, we'll break this problem down into two steps:

1. Find the area of the large circle.
2. Subtract the areas of the seven smaller circles from the area of the large circle.

### Step 1: Find the area of the large circle
We can see that the large circle's radius is the sum of the radii of three small circles (since one small circle's radius is on the outside, and the two small circles' radii are inside the large circle but on the outside of the center circle). Therefore, the radius \( r \) of the large circle is \( r = 3 \).

The formula for the area of a circle with radius \( r \) is \( \pi r^2 \). 
Substitute \( r = 3 \) into the formula:
\[ \text{Area of large circle} = \pi (3^2) = 9\pi \]

### Step 2: Subtract the areas of the seven smaller circles

The area of each small circle with radius 1 is:
\[ \pi (1^2) = \pi \]
Since there are 7 small circles:
\[ \text{Total area of 7 small circles} = 7\pi \]

Now, subtract the total area of the 7 small circles from the area of the large circle:
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 9\pi - 7\pi = 2\pi \]

So, the area of the shaded region is \( 2\pi \) square units.

Sure! Let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. The circumcenter, \( O \), of a triangle is the center of the circle that circumscribes the triangle. This circle is called the circumcircle.

2. The circumradius, \( r \), is the radius of the circumcircle. It is the distance from the circumcenter to any of the triangle's vertices. 

3. Every triangle has a unique circumcircle with its three vertices being equidistant to the center \( O \). Hence, the segments \( OA \), \( OB \), and \( OC \) are all radii of the circumcircle.

4. Since \( OB \) and \( OC \) are both radii of the circumcircle, they are congruent. Therefore, \( \triangle OBC \) is an isosceles triangle.

5. In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the congruent sides are congruent. Therefore, \( \angle OBC \) and \( \angle OCB \) are congruent.

6. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). So, we have:
\[ \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ \]

Given, \( \angle A = 68^\circ \), so:
\[ \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ - 68^\circ = 112^\circ \]

7. Since \( O \) is the circumcenter and \( OC \) is a radius, \( \angle OCA \) is half of \( \angle A \). This is a property of the circumcenter, where the measure of the angle formed at the circumcenter is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. 

\[ \angle OCA = \frac{1}{2} \angle A = \frac{1}{2} \times 68^\circ = 34^\circ \]

8. In \( \triangle OBC \):
\[ \angle OBC + \angle OCB + \angle OCA = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle OBC + \angle OBC + 34^\circ = 180^\circ \]  (since \( \triangle OBC \) is isosceles and \( \angle OBC = \angle OCB \))
\[ 2 \angle OBC = 180^\circ - 34^\circ = 146^\circ \]
\[ \angle OBC = 73^\circ \]

Hence, \( \angle OBC = 73^\circ \).

To solve this problem, we'll first find the area of triangle $ACE$ and then the area of rectangle $ABDE$. The ratio of these two areas will give us the answer.

1. **Area of triangle $ACE$:**

Triangle $ACE$ can be split into two right triangles, $ACB$ and $DCE$. 

For triangle $ACB$: 

The length of side $AB$ is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, which is $3 - 1 = 2$.
The length of side $AC$ is the difference in the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, which is $3 - 1 = 2$.

Using the formula for the area of a triangle, $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$, the area of triangle $ACB$ is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2 \]

For triangle $DCE$:

The length of side $CD$ is equal to side $AB$, which is 2.
The length of side $CE$ is the difference in the $x$-coordinates of $C$ and $E$, which is $4 - 3 = 1$.

The area of triangle $DCE$ is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the area of triangle $ACE$ is $2 + 1 = 3$.

2. **Area of rectangle $ABDE$:**

The length of side $AE$ is the difference in the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $E$, which is $4 - 1 = 3$.
The length of side $AB$ is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ (equal to side $AC$), which is $3 - 1 = 2$.

The area of rectangle $ABDE$ is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

3. **Ratio of areas:**

\[ \frac{\text{Area of triangle } ACE}{\text{Area of rectangle } ABDE} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle $ACE$ to the area of rectangle $ABDE$ is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

The formula for the area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\). 
For a semicircle, it would be half of that: \(A_{\text{semi}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2\).

2. **Calculate the area of the largest semicircle:**

With a diameter of 16 cm, its radius \(r\) is 8 cm.
\(A_{\text{semi-largest}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (8^2)\)
\(A_{\text{semi-largest}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (64)\)
\(A_{\text{semi-largest}} = 32\pi\).

3. **Calculate the area of the second-largest semicircle:**

With a diameter of 12 cm (16 - 4 = 12 cm), its radius \(r\) is 6 cm.
\(A_{\text{semi-second-largest}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (6^2)\)
\(A_{\text{semi-second-largest}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (36)\)
\(A_{\text{semi-second-largest}} = 18\pi\).

4. **Calculate the area of the third-largest semicircle:**

With a diameter of 8 cm (12 - 4 = 8 cm), its radius \(r\) is 4 cm.
\(A_{\text{semi-third-largest}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (4^2)\)
\(A_{\text{semi-third-largest}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (16)\)
\(A_{\text{semi-third-largest}} = 8\pi\).

5. **Calculate the area of the smallest semicircle:**

With a diameter of 4 cm (8 - 4 = 4 cm), its radius \(r\) is 2 cm.
\(A_{\text{semi-smallest}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2^2)\)
\(A_{\text{semi-smallest}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (4)\)
\(A_{\text{semi-smallest}} = 2\pi\).

6. **Calculate the total area of the two shaded regions:**

To get the area of the shaded regions, subtract the area of the smaller semicircles from the larger ones:
Shaded Area 1 (between largest and second-largest) = \(A_{\text{semi-largest}} - A_{\text{semi-second-largest}}\)
Shaded Area 1 = \(32\pi - 18\pi\)
Shaded Area 1 = \(14\pi\).

Shaded Area 2 (between third-largest and smallest) = \(A_{\text{semi-third-largest}} - A_{\text{semi-smallest}}\)
Shaded Area 2 = \(8\pi - 2\pi\)
Shaded Area 2 = \(6\pi\).

Total Shaded Area = Shaded Area 1 + Shaded Area 2
Total Shaded Area = \(14\pi + 6\pi\)
Total Shaded Area = \(20\pi\).

7. **Substitute the given value of \(\pi\) and solve:**

Total Shaded Area = \(20 \times 3.14\)
Total Shaded Area = 62.8 square cm.

Sure! Let's tackle this step by step.

1. **Find the interior angle of the regular decagon:**
A regular decagon has 10 equal sides and angles. The sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be found using the formula:
\[ \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ \]
Where \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon.
For a decagon, \( n = 10 \), so:
\[ \text{Sum of interior angles} = (10 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 8 \times 180^\circ = 1440^\circ \]
Now, since all the angles are equal in a regular decagon, the measure of each angle is:
\[ \text{Each angle} = \frac{\text{Sum of interior angles}}{10} = \frac{1440^\circ}{10} = 144^\circ \]

2. **Analyze the smaller quadrilateral created by the diagonal:**
The quadrilateral AFHG (going counter-clockwise starting from A) is formed by drawing the diagonal AF. We know that one angle of this quadrilateral (angle A) is \( 144^\circ \) from the previous step.

Angle F is adjacent to angle A and shares a side with the octagon. Angle F is also an exterior angle to the octagon at vertex F. The exterior angle of a polygon is given by:
\[ \text{Exterior angle} = 180^\circ - \text{Interior angle} \]
For the decagon, the exterior angle at F is:
\[ 180^\circ - 144^\circ = 36^\circ \]
Thus, angle F of the quadrilateral is \( 36^\circ \).

3. **Find the sum of angles of the quadrilateral and solve for x:**
The sum of the angles of any quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \). So for quadrilateral AFHG:
\[ \text{Angle A} + \text{Angle F} + x + \text{Angle G} = 360^\circ \]
Substituting in the values we know:
\[ 144^\circ + 36^\circ + x + 144^\circ = 360^\circ \]
\[ 324^\circ + x = 360^\circ \]
\[ x = 360^\circ - 324^\circ = 36^\circ \]

So, the measure of \( x \) is \( 36^\circ \).

Alright, let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1:** Find the apothem of the octagon.
The apothem (radius of the inscribed circle) of a regular polygon with side length \( s \) and number of sides \( n \) is given by:
\[ r = \frac{s}{2\tan(\pi/n)} \]
For our octagon with \( s = 12 \) and \( n = 8 \), this becomes:
\[ r = \frac{12}{2\tan(\pi/8)} \]

**Step 2:** Use the apothem to find the height of trapezoid \( BCDE \).
The height of trapezoid \( BCDE \) is twice the apothem because it extends from one side of the octagon to the opposite side. Therefore, the height \( h \) is:
\[ h = 2r = \frac{24}{2\tan(\pi/8)} \]

**Step 3:** Find the lengths of the bases of the trapezoid.
The shorter base \( CD \) of the trapezoid is just a side of the octagon, which is 12 cm. 
The longer base \( BE \) is the sum of two sides of the octagon plus twice the length of the segment that is perpendicular from a vertex of the octagon to its side (which is the apothem). Therefore, the length of \( BE \) is:
\[ BE = 2s + 2r = 2(12) + 2\left(\frac{12}{2\tan(\pi/8)}\right) = 24 + \frac{24}{2\tan(\pi/8)} \]

**Step 4:** Compute the area of the trapezoid.
The area \( A \) of a trapezoid with bases \( a \) and \( b \) and height \( h \) is:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} h (a + b) \]
Using our values for the bases and height:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{24}{2\tan(\pi/8)} \right) \left( 12 + 24 + \frac{24}{2\tan(\pi/8)} \right) \]

Now, simplifying this expression:
\[ A = 12 \times \frac{24}{2\tan(\pi/8)} + 24^2 \times \frac{1}{2\tan(\pi/8)} \]

Computing this will give the area of the trapezoid \( BCDE \).

Using the properties of tan:
\[ \tan(\pi/8) = \sqrt{2} - 1 \]
Therefore, the expression for the area becomes:
\[ A = 12 \times \frac{24}{2(\sqrt{2} - 1)} + 24^2 \times \frac{1}{2(\sqrt{2} - 1)} \]

Multiplying and dividing by the conjugate, we get:
\[ A = 12 \times \frac{24(\sqrt{2} + 1)}{2(2)} + 24^2 \times \frac{(\sqrt{2} + 1)}{2} \]
\[ A = 12 \times 12(\sqrt{2} + 1) + 12 \times 24(\sqrt{2} + 1) \]
\[ A = 144\sqrt{2} + 432 \]

So, the area of trapezoid \( BCDE \) is \( 144\sqrt{2} + 432 \) square centimeters.

Given: 
\[ \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \]
This means that the side opposite to angle R is 2 units long.

Step 2: Identifying the Sides.
From the given information and the triangle, we know:

\[ RS^2 + 4 = 25 \]
\[ RS^2 = 21 \]
\[ RS = \sqrt{21} \]

Step 4: Finding the Sin of angle T.
For angle T, the side opposite is RS and the hypotenuse is RT. 
Thus:
\[ \sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} \]
\[ \sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \]

Since triangle $BDC$ is isosceles, the two base angles are congruent.
This means:
\[m\angle BDC = m\angle CBD\]

Given $m\angle ABC = 70^\circ$, and considering the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$, we can find $m\angle CBD$ as:
\[m\angle CBD = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - m\angle BDC\]
\[m\angle CBD = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - m\angle CBD\]
\[2m\angle CBD = 110^\circ\]
\[m\angle CBD = 55^\circ\]

Thus, $m\angle BDC = 55^\circ$.

Step 3: Determine the Angles in Triangle $ACD$
Given triangle $ACD$ is isosceles, we have:
\[m\angle CAD = m\angle CDA\]

We also know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$. Therefore:
\[m\angle CAD + m\angle CDA + m\angle ACD = 180^\circ\]

Since $m\angle CAD = m\angle CDA$, we can rewrite the above equation as:
\[2m\angle CAD + m\angle ACD = 180^\circ\]

Using the previous step's result, we found $m\angle BDC = 55^\circ$. Since angles on a straight line sum to $180^\circ$, we have:
\[m\angle ACD = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ\]

Substituting this value into our equation gives:
\[2m\angle CAD + 125^\circ = 180^\circ\]
\[2m\angle CAD = 55^\circ\]
\[m\angle CAD = 27.5^\circ\]

Step 4: Determine $m\angle BAC$
Using the exterior angle theorem:
\[m\angle BAC = m\angle CAD + m\angle ABC\]
\[m\angle BAC = 27.5^\circ + 70^\circ = 97.5^\circ\]

Therefore, $m\angle BAC = 97.5^\circ$.

Given that \(CX\) bisects \(\angle ACB\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:

Given \(AC = 21\) and \(BC = 45\):

Alright, let's tackle the problem step-by-step.

Step 1: **Establish Known Dimensions**
We're given that $CD = 3$ (since $CDEG$ is a square, all of its sides are equal). We're also given that $BE = 5$.

Step 2: **Identify Parallel Lines and Corresponding Sides**
The quadrilateral $BEFH$ is a rectangle. Hence, its opposite sides are equal. Thus, $EF = BE = 5$.
Similarly, $BF = EH$ (but we don't know their lengths yet).

Step 3: **Express the Sides of Triangle $AEC$ in terms of Known Dimensions**
In triangle $AEC$, side $AE$ can be expressed as the sum of sides $EF$ and $AF$. We already know $EF = 5$. $AF$, on the other hand, is the same length as side $CD$ of the square, which is $3$. So, $AE = EF + AF = 5 + 3 = 8$.

Step 4: **Utilize the Pythagorean Theorem**
Now, let's look at triangle $ABE$. We know $BE = 5$, and we've just found that $AE = 8$.
Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle $ABE$, we can find $AB$:
\[ AB^2 = AE^2 - BE^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 8^2 - 5^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 64 - 25 = 39 \]
So, $AB = \sqrt{39}$.

Step 5: **Determine the Length of Side $BH$**
Since $BF$ is parallel to $EH$, and $FB$ intersects both these lines, the angle of elevation from $B$ to $F$ is equal to the angle of elevation from $H$ to $E$.
Therefore, triangles $BHF$ and $BHE$ are similar.
We can use the ratio of their sides to find $BH$.

From triangle $BHF$:
\[ \frac{BF}{AB} = \frac{FH}{BF} \]

From triangle $BHE$:
\[ \frac{BE}{AB} = \frac{EH}{BE} \]

Equating the two ratios, we have:
\[ \frac{BF}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{FH}{5} \]
\[ \frac{5}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{EH}{5} \]

Solving for $EH$, we get:
\[ EH = \frac{5^2}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{25}{\sqrt{39}} \]
Multiplying by the conjugate, we get:
\[ EH = \frac{25\sqrt{39}}{39} \]
\[ EH = \frac{5\sqrt{39}}{13} \]

Now, since $BEFH$ is a rectangle, $BH = BE + EH$.
\[ BH = 5 + \frac{5\sqrt{39}}{13} \]

To convert the radical term to a mixed number:
\[ \sqrt{39} \approx 6.245 \]
\[ \frac{5\sqrt{39}}{13} \approx 2.403 \]

Finally:
\[ BH = 5 + 2.403 = 7\frac{403}{1000} \]
\[ BH \approx 7\frac{2}{5} \]

Answer: \( BH \approx 7\frac{2}{5} \) units.

Let's start by finding the relationship between the radius of the semicircle in Figure A and the radius of the circle in Figure B.

Given that the area of the semicircle in Figure A is half the area of the circle in Figure B:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \pi r_A^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi r_B^2 \]
\[ r_A^2 = \frac{1}{2} r_B^2 \]
\[ r_A = \frac{r_B}{\sqrt{2}} \]

Now, let's find the side length of the square inscribed in the semicircle in Figure A. The diagonal of this square is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, which is \(2r_A\). Using the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90 triangle), the side length of the square is:
\[ s_A = \frac{2r_A}{\sqrt{2}} = r_A \sqrt{2} \]
Given \( r_A = \frac{r_B}{\sqrt{2}} \):
\[ s_A = \frac{r_B}{\sqrt{2}} \times \sqrt{2} = r_B \]

Now, let's find the side length of the square inscribed in the circle in Figure B. Again, the diagonal of this square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is \(2r_B\). The side length of the square is:
\[ s_B = \frac{2r_B}{\sqrt{2}} = r_B \sqrt{2} \]

Now, we'll find the ratio of the areas of the two squares:
\[ \left( \frac{s_A}{s_B} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{r_B}{r_B \sqrt{2}} \right)^2 \]
\[ = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 \]

Alright, let's start by setting up the relationship between the perimeters of the two shapes.

**Step 1:** Establish the relationship using the given information.
Let's denote the side length of the square as \( s \) and the side length of the triangle as \( t \). 
The perimeter of the square is \( 4s \) and the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is \( 3t \).
Given that these two perimeters are equal, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 4s = 3t \]
From this, we can deduce:
\[ s = \frac{3t}{4} \]

**Step 2:** Use the area of the triangle to find \( t \).
The formula for the area (\( A \)) of an equilateral triangle with side length \( t \) is:
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} t^2 \]
Given that \( A = 16\sqrt{3} \), we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} t^2 = 16\sqrt{3} \]
Dividing both sides by \( \sqrt{3} \) gives:
\[ \frac{t^2}{4} = 16 \]
Multiplying both sides by 4:
\[ t^2 = 64 \]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ t = 8 \]
So, the side length of the equilateral triangle is 8 centimeters.

**Step 3:** Use the side length of the triangle to find the side length of the square.
From step 1, we know that:
\[ s = \frac{3t}{4} \]
Plugging in \( t = 8 \) gives:
\[ s = \frac{3(8)}{4} = 6 \]
So, the side length of the square is 6 centimeters.

**Step 4:** Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal of the square.
The diagonal (\( d \)) of the square can be found using the Pythagorean theorem since it divides the square into two congruent right triangles:
\[ d^2 = s^2 + s^2 = 2s^2 \]
Plugging in \( s = 6 \) gives:
\[ d^2 = 2(6^2) = 72 \]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ d = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2} \]

So, the length of the diagonal of the square is \( 6\sqrt{2} \) centimeters.

Given the information, let's proceed step by step:

1. Since $AD = BD$, $\triangle ABD$ is isosceles. This means $\angle BAD = \angle ABD$. Let's call this angle $x$.

2. Similarly, since $AD = CD$, $\triangle ADC$ is also isosceles. Therefore, $\angle DAC = \angle ADC$. Let's call this angle $y$.

3. We're given that $\angle BCA = 40^\circ$. Also, because $\triangle ADC$ is isosceles, $\angle ADC = y$. So, $\angle BCD = 180^\circ - 40^\circ - y = 140^\circ - y$.

4. In $\triangle BCD$, since $BD = CD$, it is also isosceles, which means $\angle CBD = \angle BDC$. So, $\angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - (140^\circ - y)}{2} = 70^\circ + \frac{y}{2}$.

5. Now, let's consider $\triangle ABD$. We know that $\angle BAD = x$ and $\angle CBD = 70^\circ + \frac{y}{2}$. The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$, so $\angle ABD = 180^\circ - x - (70^\circ + \frac{y}{2}) = 110^\circ - \frac{y}{2} - x$.

6. But since $\triangle ABD$ is isosceles, $\angle ABD = x$. Therefore, $x = 110^\circ - \frac{y}{2} - x$, which implies $2x = 110^\circ - \frac{y}{2}$ or $x = 55^\circ - \frac{y}{4}$.

7. Finally, in triangle $ABC$, the sum of angles is $180^\circ$. So, $\angle BAC = 180^\circ - 40^\circ - x - y = 140^\circ - x - y$. Substituting the value of $x$ from the previous step, we get:
$$\angle BAC = 140^\circ - (55^\circ - \frac{y}{4}) - y = 85^\circ - \frac{3y}{4}$$

8. Now, using the fact that $\angle DAC = y$, $\angle BAC + y = 85^\circ - \frac{y}{2}$.

9. But $\angle BAC + y = x$. Thus, $x = 85^\circ - \frac{y}{2}$. Using the relation found in step 6, we equate the two expressions for $x$:
$$55^\circ - \frac{y}{4} = 85^\circ - \frac{y}{2}$$

10. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 60^\circ$.

11. Substituting this into our expression for $\angle BAC$, we find:
$$\angle BAC = 85^\circ - \frac{3(60^\circ)}{4} = 85^\circ - 45^\circ = 40^\circ.$$

So, the measure of $\angle BAC$ is \(40^\circ\).

We are given a square $ABCD$ with side length $10$. Point $E$ is on side $\overline{BC}$, and the area of triangle $ABE$ is $40$ square units. We need to find the length of segment $\overline{BE}$.

**Step 2:** Visualize the problem.

From the given diagram, we can see that $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle CDE$ are similar right triangles, as they both share angle $\angle BAE$. 

**Step 3:** Express the area of $\triangle ABE$ in terms of $BE$.

The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
For $\triangle ABE$, the base is $BE$ and the height is $AB$. 

So, 
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABE = \frac{1}{2} \times BE \times 10 \]

Given that this area is $40$ square units, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times BE \times 10 = 40 \]

**Step 4:** Solve for $BE$.

From the equation above:
\[ 5 \times BE = 40 \]
\[ BE = 8 \]

Thus, the length of segment $\overline{BE}$ is $\boxed{8}$ units.

To determine the volume of solid $QPCDMN,$ we can approach the problem by finding the volume of the entire prism and subtracting the volumes of the three triangular prisms that were cut off.

**Step 1:** Find the volume of the entire prism.

The base of the prism is an equilateral triangle with side length $12.$ The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by:
\[A = \frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4}.\]

Plugging in the value $s = 12$ gives:
\[A = \frac{12^2\sqrt{3}}{4} = 36\sqrt{3}.\]

The volume $V$ of a prism is given by the product of the base area and the height:
\[V = A \times h.\]

Using $h = 16,$ we get:
\[V = 36\sqrt{3} \times 16 = 576\sqrt{3}.\]

**Step 2:** Find the volume of the three triangular prisms that were cut off.

For the three triangular prisms, we have:

2. Triangular prism with base $QPA$ and height $DE - DM = 16 - 4 = 12.$
3. Triangular prism with base $PNB$ and height $DF - DN = 16 - 2 = 14.$

**Triangular prism with base $QPC$ and height $DM = 4:**  
Since $CQ = 8,$ we have $QP = \frac{12 - 8}{2} = 2.$  
Using similar triangles, we find that $PC = 4.$  
Thus, the base is an equilateral triangle with side length $4.$ The area of this triangle is:
\[A_1 = \frac{4^2\sqrt{3}}{4} = 4\sqrt{3}.\]
Volume of this prism is:
\[V_1 = 4\sqrt{3} \times 4 = 16\sqrt{3}.\]

**Triangular prism with base $QPA$ and height $DE - DM = 12:**  
Using similar triangles, we can find that $PA = 6$ and $QA = 3.$  
The area of this triangle is half of an equilateral triangle with side length $12,$ which is:
\[A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{12^2\sqrt{3}}{4} = 18\sqrt{3}.\]
Volume of this prism is:
\[V_2 = 18\sqrt{3} \times 12 = 216\sqrt{3}.\]

**Triangular prism with base $PNB$ and height $DF - DN = 14:**  
Using similar triangles, we can find that $NB = 8$ and $PB = 4.$  
The area of this triangle is half of an equilateral triangle with side length $12,$ which is:
\[A_3 = 18\sqrt{3}.\]
Volume of this prism is:
\[V_3 = 18\sqrt{3} \times 14 = 252\sqrt{3}.\]

**Step 3:** Find the volume of solid $QPCDMN.$

The volume of solid $QPCDMN$ is:
\[V_{QPCDMN} = V - (V_1 + V_2 + V_3) = 576\sqrt{3} - (16\sqrt{3} + 216\sqrt{3} + 252\sqrt{3}) = 92\sqrt{3}.\]

The shaded region is \(20\%\) of the entire circle's area. This implies that the angle subtended by the unshaded region at the center \(O\) is \(20\%\) of the total angle of a circle, which is \(360^\circ\).

**Step 2: Calculating the angle subtended by the unshaded region**
\(20\%\) of \(360^\circ\) is:
\(0.20 \times 360^\circ = 72^\circ\)

This means that the unshaded region subtends an angle of \(72^\circ\) at the center.

**Step 3: Calculating the angle of the shaded region**
The entire circle subtends an angle of \(360^\circ\). If the unshaded region subtends \(72^\circ\), then the angle subtended by the shaded region is:
\[360^\circ - 72^\circ = 288^\circ\]

However, the shaded region consists of two equal segments. Therefore, the angle \(x\) corresponding to one segment is half of \(288^\circ\):
\[x = \frac{288^\circ}{2} = 144^\circ\]

Therefore, \(\angle RAT = 2 \times \angle RAS = 2 \times 74^\circ = 148^\circ\).

Step 2: Determine the measure of arc \( RT \).

Arcs in a circle are measured by the central angle that they subtend. In this case, \(\angle RAT \) subtends arc \( RT \), so the measure of arc \( RT \) is the same as the measure of \(\angle RAT \).
Thus, arc \( RT = 148^\circ \).

Step 3: Find the measure of \(\angle RBT\).

We're given that the measure of \(\angle RTB \) is \( 28^\circ \). Since the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to \( 180^\circ \), 
\(\angle RBT + \angle RTB = 180^\circ\).
Substituting the given value, 
\(\angle RBT = 180^\circ - 28^\circ = 152^\circ\).

Step 4: Determine the measure of arc \( BR \).

Arc \( BR \) is subtended by \(\angle RBT \), so its measure is the same as the measure of \(\angle RBT \).
Therefore, arc \( BR = 152^\circ \).

Based on the above reasoning, the measure of minor arc \( BR \) is \( \boxed{152^\circ} \).

To solve the problem, let's determine the areas of each of the semicircles and then calculate the shaded and unshaded areas.

**Step 1:** Find the radius of each semi-circle.
Given the ratio $AB:BC:CD = 1:2:3$, and knowing that the segments represent the diameters of the respective semicircles, the radii of the semicircles with diameters AB, BC, and CD are 0.5, 1, and 1.5, respectively. The diameter of the largest semi-circle, AD, is the sum of AB, BC, and CD, so its radius is 0.5 + 1 + 1.5 = 3.

**Step 2:** Calculate the areas of each of the semicircles.
The area of a semicircle with radius \( r \) is given by \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \).

- Area of semi-circle with diameter AB (unshaded): \( \frac{1}{2} \pi (0.5^2) = \frac{1}{8} \pi \)
- Area of semi-circle with diameter BC (unshaded): \( \frac{1}{2} \pi (1^2) = \frac{1}{2} \pi \)

- Area of semi-circle with diameter AD (both shaded and unshaded): \( \frac{1}{2} \pi (3^2) = \frac{9}{2} \pi \)

**Step 3:** Determine the shaded area.
The shaded area is the area of the largest semi-circle minus the areas of the three smaller semicircles.

Shaded area = \( \frac{9}{2} \pi - \frac{1}{8} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \pi - \frac{9}{8} \pi \)

= \( -\frac{3}{8} \pi \) (Note that the negative sign indicates we subtracted the areas in the wrong order, but it's the magnitude that's important.)

Shaded area = \( \frac{3}{8} \pi \)

**Step 4:** Determine the unshaded area.
The unshaded area is the sum of the areas of the three smaller semicircles:

Unshaded area = \( \frac{1}{8} \pi + \frac{1}{2} \pi + \frac{9}{8} \pi \)
= \( \frac{21}{8} \pi \)

**Step 5:** Calculate the ratio of the shaded area to the unshaded area.

Ratio = \( \frac{\frac{3}{8} \pi}{\frac{21}{8} \pi} \)
= \( \frac{3}{21} \)

\[ x^2 + y^2 = 49 \]

**Step 3:** Find the coordinates of point $S(0,k)$.

From the diagram, $S(0,k)$ lies on the y-axis (since its x-coordinate is 0) and on the smaller circle. Plugging $x=0$ into the equation of the smaller circle:

Since the sector is \(\frac{1}{12}\) of the entire circle (because there are 12 congruent central angles), the area of the entire sector is:
\(\frac{1}{12} \times 16\pi = \frac{4}{3}\pi\).

2. **Find the Area of the Unshaded Sector:**
The unshaded sector is the part from the center of the circle to the inner circle with a radius of 2 feet. The entire inner circle has an area of \(\pi r^2 = \pi (2^2) = 4\pi\). The area of the unshaded sector, which is \(\frac{1}{12}\) of the entire inner circle, is:
\(\frac{1}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{1}{3}\pi\).

3. **Subtract the Unshaded from the Entire Sector:**
To find the area of the shaded region, subtract the unshaded sector area from the entire sector area:

Let's draw the diameter of the circle passing through the midpoint of the chord of length 14. Let's call the points where this diameter intersects the circle as A and B. Let's call the midpoint of the chord as M and the center of the circle as O.

2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**
Since AM is a radius and is perpendicular to the chord (since the diameter bisects the chord at a right angle), we have a right triangle OAM.

Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle OAM, we get: 
\[OA^2 = AM^2 + OM^2\]

Given that OM is half the length of the chord, we have OM = 7.

Repeating this process for the chord of length 10, if we call its midpoint N, then ON = 5.
Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle OAN, we get:
\[r^2 = 25 + ON^2\]

4. **Finding the distance between M and N:**
The given distance between the chords is 6 units. This means that the distance between M and N is 3 units (since the chords are equidistant from the center). 

Using the two equations we derived from steps 2 and 3, we can deduce that:

\[r^2 = OP^2 + AP^2\]
\[r^2 = OP^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{2}\right)^2\]
\[r^2 = OP^2 + \frac{a}{4}\]

6. **Comparing the Equations:**
Since \(ON^2 - 9 = OP^2\), we have:
\[33 - 9 = OP^2\]
\[OP^2 = 24\]

Using this in the equation from step 5, we get:
\[r^2 = 24 + \frac{a}{4}\]

Since we know \(r^2\) from the equations in steps 2 and 3, and they are both equal to the same radius squared, we can equate them:
\[49 + OM^2 = 24 + \frac{a}{4}\]
\[OM^2 = \frac{a}{4} - 25\]

Using the relationship \(ON^2 - OM^2 = 9\), we can solve for \(a\):
\[33 - \left(\frac{a}{4} - 25\right) = 9\]
\[a = 4(33 - 9 + 25)\]
\[a = 4(49)\]

Step 2: Use the properties of a square.
Since $ABCD$ is a square, all its sides are of equal length and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Therefore, $AB = BC = CD = AD = 5$ and $AC \perp BD$. We need to find the length of diagonal $PD$.

Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem again.
Triangle $PAD$ is also a right triangle. We know $PA = 3$ and $AD = 5$ (because it's a side of the square). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[PA^2 + AD^2 = PD^2\]
\[3^2 + 5^2 = PD^2\]
\[9 + 25 = PD^2\]
\[PD^2 = 34\]
\[PD = \sqrt{34}\]

Thus, the length of $PD$ is \(\boxed{\sqrt{34}}\).

We will first find the dimensions of the rectangle and then use them to find the area of triangle \(EHJ\).

**Step 1**: Find the dimensions of the rectangle.
Given that the area of rectangle \(ABCD\) is 70, let the length \(AB\) be \(x\) and the width \(AD\) be \(y\). Then \(xy = 70\). 

As points F and G divide AB into three equal parts, each segment is \(\frac{x}{3}\).

**Step 2**: Find the coordinates of each point.
Let's use a coordinate system. Place point A at the origin, so \(A = (0,0)\). Then:
- \(B = (x,0)\)
- \(D = (0,y)\)
- \(C = (x,y)\)
- \(F = (\frac{x}{3},0)\)
- \(G = (2\frac{x}{3},0)\)
- \(E = (x, \frac{y}{2})\)

**Step 3**: Find the equations of lines AC, EF, and EG.
Line \(AC\) passes through \(A(0,0)\) and \(C(x,y)\). The equation of line \(AC\) is \(\frac{y}{x}x = y\), which simplifies to \(y = \frac{y}{x}x\).

Line \(EF\) passes through \(E(x,\frac{y}{2})\) and \(F(\frac{x}{3},0)\). Using point-slope form and these two points, we can derive the equation of line \(EF\) as \(y = -\frac{y}{2x}x + \frac{y}{2}\).

Line \(EG\) passes through \(E(x,\frac{y}{2})\) and \(G(2\frac{x}{3},0)\). Using the same method, the equation of line \(EG\) is \(y = -\frac{3y}{2x}x + \frac{3y}{2}\).

**Step 4**: Find the coordinates of points H and J.
H is the intersection of lines AC and EF. By setting the two equations equal, we can solve for x to get the x-coordinate of H:
\[y = \frac{y}{x}x = -\frac{y}{2x}x + \frac{y}{2}\]
\[x = 2\frac{x}{3}\]
From this, we can deduce that \(H = (2\frac{x}{3}, \frac{2y}{3})\).

J is the intersection of lines AC and EG:
\[y = \frac{y}{x}x = -\frac{3y}{2x}x + \frac{3y}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{2x}{3}\]
Hence, \(J = (\frac{2x}{3}, y)\).

**Step 5**: Calculate the area of triangle \(EHJ\).
The base \(EJ\) is half the width of the rectangle, which is \(\frac{y}{2}\). 
The height of triangle \(EHJ\) (which is perpendicular to \(EJ\)) is the difference between the x-coordinates of E and H, which is \(x - 2\frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{3}\). 

Thus, the area of triangle \(EHJ\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{y}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{xy}{12}\). 

Given that \(xy = 70\), the area of triangle \(EHJ\) is \(\frac{70}{12} = \frac{35}{6}\) or \(5\frac{5}{6}\).

The area of triangle \(EHJ\) is \(5\frac{5}{6}\) square units.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Unknown and Establish Relations:**
The problem is asking for the length of one side of the resulting octagon. This length can be considered as the remaining portion of one side of the square after cutting off the two triangles. 

If we take one side of the square, two triangles are cut off from its ends, leaving the side of the octagon in the middle. Let's denote the side length of the isosceles right triangle as \( x \) and the length of one side of the octagon as \( y \).

Therefore, we can set up this relation:
\[ x + x + y = 10 \]
\[ 2x + y = 10 \]
\[ y = 10 - 2x \]
\( y \) is what we're trying to find.

2. **Use Properties of the Isosceles Right Triangle:**
An isosceles right triangle has one right angle and two angles of 45 degrees each. This means that the two legs of the triangle are congruent.

The hypotenuse of the triangle will be the side length of the square which is 10 inches. So:
\[ x^2 + x^2 = 10^2 \]
\[ 2x^2 = 100 \]
\[ x^2 = 50 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{50} \]
\[ x = 5\sqrt{2} \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
Now, let's plug the value of \( x \) into our original relation to solve for \( y \):
\[ y = 10 - 2(5\sqrt{2}) \]
\[ y = 10 - 10\sqrt{2} \]

4. **Express in Decimal Form:**
\[ 10\sqrt{2} \] is approximately 14.14. So:
\[ y \approx 10 - 14.14 \]
\[ y \approx -4.14 \]

However, this doesn't seem right since we cannot have a negative length. Let's reevaluate our process.

5. **Re-evaluate the Triangle:**
I made a mistake earlier. The hypotenuse of the isosceles right triangle is not the side length of the square, but rather it's one of the sides of the triangle. So the side length of the square will be the sum of two legs of the triangle.

So, the relation for the side of the isosceles triangle becomes:
\[ x + x = 10 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Now, using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the hypotenuse (which is also the side length of the octagon we're trying to find):
\[ x^2 + x^2 = y^2 \]
\[ 5^2 + 5^2 = y^2 \]
\[ 50 = y^2 \]
\[ y = \sqrt{50} \]
\[ y = 5\sqrt{2} \]

Using approximation:
\[ 5\sqrt{2} \] is approximately 7.07 inches.

Thus, the length of one side of the octagon is approximately \( 7.07 \) inches.

Let's break this problem down step by step.

**Step 1**: Sketch the problem and label what's given.
This step has already been done for us in the prompt.

**Step 2**: Observe triangle $ABE$. 
From the problem, we know that $AF$ is tangent to the circle at $A$. Therefore, $AE$ is perpendicular to $AF$ (as a radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent). Thus, triangle $ABE$ is a right triangle, with right angle at $A$.

**Step 3**: Use the Pythagorean Theorem for triangle $ABE$.
Given $AF = \sqrt{9+5\sqrt{2}}$ and $AE = r$ (radius of the circle), $BE$ is the hypotenuse of the triangle and can be expressed as:
\[BE^2 = AE^2 + AB^2\]
\[BE^2 = r^2 + (r-s)^2\]
\[BE^2 = 2r^2 - 2rs + s^2\]

**Step 4**: Use the Pythagorean Theorem for triangle $ADF$.
Using the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $ADF$, we have:
\[DF^2 = AF^2 - AD^2\]
\[DF^2 = (9 + 5\sqrt{2}) - s^2\]

**Step 5**: Use the properties of circles to relate $DF$ and $DE$.
The line $DF$ is a secant line to the circle, intersecting the circle at points $D$ and $F$. $DE$ is a segment from the center of the circle to a point on the circle. Using the properties of secants, we can relate $DF$ and $DE$:
\[DE^2 = DF \cdot (DF + 2r)\]

Substituting in our expression for $DF$ from step 4:
\[r^2 = (9 + 5\sqrt{2} - s^2)(9 + 5\sqrt{2} - s^2 + 2r)\]

**Step 6**: Set up an equation and solve for $r$ and $s$.
We now have two expressions for $r^2$. Setting them equal to each other gives:
\[2r^2 - 2rs + s^2 = (9 + 5\sqrt{2} - s^2)(9 + 5\sqrt{2} - s^2 + 2r)\]

This is a quadratic equation in terms of $r$ and $s$. Solving it will give us the relationship between $r$ and $s$.

Upon solving the equation, you find that $r = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}$ and $s = 2\sqrt{2}$. 

Hence, the ratio \(\frac{r}{s} = \frac{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (3 + 2\sqrt{2}) = \sqrt{2} + 3\).

**Answer**: \(r/s = \sqrt{2} + 3\).

Alright, let's solve this problem step by step.

**Step 1:** Understand the given information.

From the diagram, we can infer that ∠RPQ is an acute angle. We're given that 
\[ \sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25} \]

By definition, for a right triangle:
\[ \sin \angle = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \]

From this, we can determine the lengths of sides of the triangle RPQ. Let RP be the opposite side and PQ be the hypotenuse for ∠RPQ. Therefore, we can say:
\[ \frac{RP}{PQ} = \frac{7}{25} \]

**Step 2:** Determine the missing side.

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle RPQ:
\[ RP^2 + PQ^2 = RQ^2 \]

Given \( RP = \frac{7x}{25} \) (where x is a constant) and \( PQ = x \), we can find:
\[ \left(\frac{7x}{25}\right)^2 + x^2 = RQ^2 \]
\[ \frac{49x^2}{625} + x^2 = RQ^2 \]
\[ \frac{49x^2 + 625x^2}{625} = RQ^2 \]
\[ \frac{674x^2}{625} = RQ^2 \]

To find the value of RQ, take the square root on both sides:
\[ RQ = x\sqrt{\frac{674}{625}} \]
\[ RQ = x\sqrt{\frac{337}{312.5}} \]
\[ RQ = x\frac{\sqrt{337}}{17.68} \]  (approximately)

**Step 3:** Determine \( \cos \angle RPS \).

Now, considering the triangle RPS, the angle \( \angle RPS \) is complementary to \( \angle RPQ \). We know that:
\[ \sin \angle RPQ = \cos \angle RPS \]

Given \( \sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25} \), it follows that:
\[ \cos \angle RPS = \frac{7}{25} \]

Thus, \( \boxed{\cos \angle RPS = \frac{7}{25}} \).

To solve this problem, we can use properties of similar figures and the relationship between their areas.

**Step 1**: Understand the problem
Since rhombus $ABCD$ is similar to rhombus $BFDE$, the sides of the two rhombi are in proportion. Let's let $AB = x$ and $BF = y$. Because all sides of a rhombus are congruent, $BC = CD = DA = x$ and $DE = EF = FD = y$.

**Step 2**: Using the given angle to determine height
Given that $\angle BAD = 60^\circ$, we can determine the height of rhombus $ABCD$ by dropping a perpendicular from $D$ to $AB$. The length of this perpendicular (height with respect to base $AB$) is $DA \times \sin(60^\circ) = x \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

**Step 3**: Determining the area of rhombus $ABCD$ using its base and height
The area of rhombus $ABCD$ is given by:
\[ \text{Area}_{ABCD} = AB \times h = x \times x \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]
Given that $\text{Area}_{ABCD} = 24$, we can solve for $x$:
\[ x^2 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 24 \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{24 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = 48 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = 16\sqrt{3} \]
\[ x = 4\sqrt{3} \]

**Step 4**: Using similarity to find the side length $y$
Because the rhombi are similar, the ratio of their side lengths is equal to the ratio of their areas' square roots:
\[ \frac{y}{4\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\text{Area}_{BFDE}^{1/2}}{24^{1/2}} \]
\[ \frac{y}{4\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\text{Area}_{BFDE}^{1/2}}{2\sqrt{6}} \]

**Step 5**: Relating the areas using the ratio
Using the properties of similar figures, the ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths:
\[ \frac{\text{Area}_{BFDE}}{24} = \left(\frac{y}{4\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 \]
\[ \frac{\text{Area}_{BFDE}}{24} = \left(\frac{\text{Area}_{BFDE}^{1/2}}{2\sqrt{6}}\right)^2 \]
\[ \text{Area}_{BFDE} = 24 \times \left(\frac{\text{Area}_{BFDE}^{1/2}}{2\sqrt{6}}\right)^2 \]
Let $a = \text{Area}_{BFDE}^{1/2}$. Then, 
\[ \text{Area}_{BFDE} = \frac{24a^2}{24} \]
\[ \text{Area}_{BFDE} = a^2 \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ a = \sqrt{\text{Area}_{BFDE}} \]
Given that $a$ is also equal to $\text{Area}_{BFDE}^{1/2}$, we can equate the two:
\[ \sqrt{\text{Area}_{BFDE}} = \text{Area}_{BFDE}^{1/2} \]
This is only true when $\text{Area}_{BFDE} = 1$, which means:
\[ \text{Area}_{BFDE} = 1 \]

So, the area of rhombus $BFDE$ is $\boxed{1}$.

Alright! We have a triangle ABC with a segment DC drawn perpendicular to AC.

Let's tackle the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:** Note that triangle ADC is a right triangle because of the perpendicular line. 

Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle ADC:
\[AD^2 + DC^2 = AC^2\]

We are given:
\[AC = 13\]
\[DC = 2\]

Plugging in the values we get:
\[AD^2 + 2^2 = 13^2\]
\[AD^2 = 169 - 4\]
\[AD^2 = 165\]
\[AD = \sqrt{165}\]
\[AD = \sqrt{15^2 - 3^2}\]
\[AD = \sqrt{225 - 9}\]
\[AD = \sqrt{216}\]
\[AD = 6\sqrt{6}\]

**Step 2:** Now, consider triangle ABD. Again, using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\]
\[BD^2 = AB^2 - AD^2\]

Since AB is the hypotenuse of right triangle ABC, we can determine its length using triangle ABC and the given length of AC:
\[AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2\]
\[BC^2 = AC^2 - AB^2\]
\[BC^2 = 13^2 - (6\sqrt{6})^2\]
\[BC^2 = 169 - 216\]
\[BC^2 = -47\]

However, a squared value cannot be negative. This indicates an error in our calculations. We made a mistake in the last step.

Revisiting triangle ABC, we actually have:
\[AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2\]
\[AB^2 = AC^2 - BC^2\]

We know that BC = DC (because they are opposite sides of a rectangle), so:
\[AB^2 = 13^2 - 2^2\]
\[AB^2 = 169 - 4\]
\[AB^2 = 165\]

**Step 3:** Now, we can determine BD using triangle ABD:
\[BD^2 = 165 - (6\sqrt{6})^2\]
\[BD^2 = 165 - 216\]
\[BD^2 = -51\]

Again, we've made a mistake. The squared value can't be negative. Let's try a different approach.

Using triangle ABD:
\[BD^2 = AB^2 - AD^2\]
\[BD^2 = 165 - 216\]
\[BD^2 = -51\]

This is the same mistake we made earlier. Let's rethink.

**Step 4:** We realize that in triangle ABD, AD is not one of the legs, but the hypotenuse. So, the relation becomes:
\[AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2\]
\[BD^2 = AD^2 - AB^2\]
\[BD^2 = (6\sqrt{6})^2 - 165\]
\[BD^2 = 216 - 165\]
\[BD^2 = 51\]
\[BD = \sqrt{51}\]
\[BD = 3\sqrt{17}\]

So, the length of segment BD is \(3\sqrt{17}\) units.

To determine the area of the pentagon, one effective approach is to split the shape into triangles and compute the area of each triangle separately. Then, we can sum the areas of the triangles to get the total area of the pentagon.

Let's label the vertices as follows:
A (-1, -1)
B (-3, 4)
C (1, 7)
D (6, 5)
E (3, -1)

We can break the pentagon into three triangles:
1. Triangle ABC
2. Triangle AED
3. Triangle CDE

1. For Triangle ABC:

The area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2)| \]

Using the coordinates of A, B, and C, we have:
\[ \text{Area}_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} |-1(4-7) - 3(7+1) + 1(-1-4)| \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} |3 + 24 - 5| \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times 22 \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ABC} = 11 \text{ square units} \]

2. For Triangle AED:

Using the formula with vertices A, E, and D:
\[ \text{Area}_{AED} = \frac{1}{2} |-1(-1-5) + 3(5+1) + 6(-1+1)| \]
\[ \text{Area}_{AED} = \frac{1}{2} |6 + 18| \]
\[ \text{Area}_{AED} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Area}_{AED} = 12 \text{ square units} \]

3. For Triangle CDE:

Using the formula with vertices C, D, and E:
\[ \text{Area}_{CDE} = \frac{1}{2} |1(5-(-1)) + 6(-1-7) + 3(7-5)| \]
\[ \text{Area}_{CDE} = \frac{1}{2} |6 - 48 + 4| \]
\[ \text{Area}_{CDE} = \frac{1}{2} \times (-38) \]
\[ \text{Area}_{CDE} = -19 \text{ square units} \]

(Note: The negative value just means we've considered the vertices in the opposite order. The magnitude is what matters for area.)

Adding the areas of the three triangles together, we get:
\[ \text{Total Area} = 11 + 12 + 19 \]
\[ \text{Total Area} = 42 \text{ square units} \]

Thus, the area of the pentagon is \(42 \text{ square units}\).

To find the area of the semi-circle with center \( K \), we need to determine its radius. Once we have the radius, we can use the formula for the area of a semi-circle, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \).

Step 1: Calculate the diameter of the semi-circle with center \( K \).

From the information given, \( OC = 32 \) and \( CB = 36 \). Therefore, the entire segment \( AC = OC + CB = 32 + 36 = 68 \).

Since \( K \) is the center of the semi-circle, it is also the midpoint of segment \( AC \). Therefore, the diameter \( AK \) of the semi-circle with center \( K \) is half of \( AC \):

\[ AK = \frac{1}{2} \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 = 34 \]

Step 2: Calculate the radius of the semi-circle with center \( K \).

The radius is half of the diameter, so:
\[ r = \frac{1}{2} \times AK = \frac{1}{2} \times 34 = 17 \]

Step 3: Calculate the area of the semi-circle with center \( K \).

Using the formula for the area of a semi-circle, \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \):

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (17^2) = \frac{1}{2} \pi (289) = 144.5\pi \]

So, the area of the semi-circle with center \( K \) is \( 144.5\pi \) square units.

Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle ABD:
AB^2 + AD^2 = AD^2
6^2 + x^2 = 10^2
36 + x^2 = 100
x^2 = 64
x = 8

So, AD = 8 cm.

Step 3: Compute the length of the segment BM.
Since M is the midpoint of AC, the length of AM is half the length of AC.

AM = AC/2 = 10/2 = 5 cm

Step 4: Use similar triangles to find BX.
Triangles AXB and ADC are similar because they share angle A, and the angles at A are both right angles due to the perpendicular and the nature of the rectangle.

Using the properties of similar triangles, we get:
AB/AD = BX/AC
6/8 = BX/10
3/4 = BX/10
BX = (3/4) * 10 = 7.5 cm

Step 5: Find XM, which is the distance between point X and the midpoint M.
XM = AM - BX
XM = 5 - 7.5
XM = -2.5 cm

However, since distance cannot be negative, the absolute value of XM is taken.
So, XM = 2.5 cm

Therefore, point X is 2.5 cm away from the midpoint M of the diagonal AC.

**Step 2:** Find the length of \( AP \).

Since \( AO \) is 10 units long and is bisected by \( OP \), each half, \( AP \) and \( OP \), will have a length of \( \frac{AO}{2} \) which is 5 units. Thus, \( AP = 5 \) units.

**Step 3:** Use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle \( DAP \) to find \( DP \).

In right triangle \( DAP \):
\( AD^2 = AP^2 + DP^2 \)

Given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( AP = 5 \), substituting in these values we get:
\( 10^2 = 5^2 + DP^2 \)
\( 100 = 25 + DP^2 \)
\( DP^2 = 75 \)
\( DP = \sqrt{75} \)
\( DP = 5\sqrt{3} \) units.

**Step 4:** Use the properties of a trapezoid to find \( OP \).

In trapezoid \( ABCD \), the height (or altitude) \( OP \) is the difference between the two legs of the trapezoid. 

Using the length of \( DP \) we just found:
\[ OP = DO - DP \]
Given \( DO = 12 \) and \( DP = 5\sqrt{3} \), 
\[ OP = 12 - 5\sqrt{3} \]

And that is the length of \( OP \).

Since \( \triangle ABE \) is equilateral, its side length is 4 (same as the side of square \( ABCD \)).

**Step 2: Finding \( EP \)**

Since \( AB = 4 \) and \( AE = 4 \), segment \( EB \) is divided into two equal segments by point \( P \). Thus, \( EP = BP = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

**Step 3: Using the Pythagorean theorem on \(\triangle AEP\)**

In right triangle \( \triangle AEP \), \( AE \) is the hypotenuse. Since \( AE = 4 \) and \( EP = 2 \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for \( AP \):

\[ AP^2 + EP^2 = AE^2 \]
\[ AP^2 + 2^2 = 4^2 \]
\[ AP^2 = 16 - 4 \]
\[ AP^2 = 12 \]
\[ AP = 2\sqrt{3} \]

**Step 4: Using properties of similar triangles**

We notice that triangles \( \triangle APQ \) and \( \triangle APC \) are similar, because they share the angle at \( P \), and both have a right angle.

Let's set up a proportion using the corresponding sides:

\[ \frac{PQ}{PC} = \frac{AP}{AC} \]

Since \( AC \) is a diagonal of the square, its length is \( 4\sqrt{2} \).

Using the given and the calculated lengths:

\[ \frac{x}{4} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{2}} \]

Cross multiplying:

\[ x \cdot 4\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{3} \]
\[ x = 2\sqrt{3} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} \]

Angle \( ABC \) = \( 180^\circ \) - 2(35^\circ) = \( 180^\circ \) - 70^\circ = 110^\circ.

Step 2: Find the measure of angle \( ACB \).
Using the property of angles in a triangle:
Angle \( ACB \) = 180^\circ - (Angle \( ABC \) + Angle \( BAC \))
Angle \( ACB \) = 180^\circ - (110^\circ + 35^\circ) = 35^\circ.

Step 3: Find the measure of angle \( BCD \).
Because a circle has a total angle of \( 360^\circ \) around its center, and we know that angle \( ABC \) is \( 110^\circ \), the arc \( BC \) spans \( 110^\circ \). The angle at the circumference (angle \( BCD \)) subtended by this arc is half the angle at the center subtended by the same arc. Hence:
Angle \( BCD \) = 0.5 x \( 110^\circ \) = 55^\circ.

Step 4: Find the measure of angle \( CDA \).
Since \( CDA \) and \( BCD \) are angles on a straight line:
Angle \( CDA \) = 180^\circ - Angle \( BCD \)
Angle \( CDA \) = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ.

Therefore, the measure of angle \( CDA \) is \( 125^\circ \).

\[ \text{Sum of interior angles} = (7 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ \]

Now, since the heptagon is regular, all its interior angles are equal. Therefore, the measure of each interior angle is:
\[ \text{Each interior angle} = \frac{900^\circ}{7} = 128\frac{4}{7}^\circ \]

**Step 2:** Consider the quadrilateral that has been formed by the diagonal.
The sum of interior angles of any quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \). Let's name the angle opposite to \( x \) in the quadrilateral as \( y \).

From the heptagon's properties, we know the measure of \( y \) is \( 128\frac{4}{7}^\circ \).

Now, within the quadrilateral, we have 2 angles each measuring \( 128\frac{4}{7}^\circ \), one angle \( x \), and one right angle which is \( 90^\circ \) (because the heptagon is regular and it's split into 7 equal parts, one of which is a right angle).

Setting up the equation for the sum of interior angles of the quadrilateral:
\[ 2 \times 128\frac{4}{7}^\circ + x + 90^\circ = 360^\circ \]

Expanding, we get:
\[ 257\frac{2}{7}^\circ + x + 90^\circ = 360^\circ \]
\[ x + 347\frac{2}{7}^\circ = 360^\circ \]
\[ x = 12\frac{5}{7}^\circ \]

**Conclusion:**
The measure of \( x \) is \( 12\frac{5}{7}^\circ \).

To find the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\), we need to know its height. Once we have the height, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} (\text{base}_1 + \text{base}_2) \times \text{height} \]

Let's label a few points to help us determine the height. Let \(E\) be the point on \(\overline{AD}\) such that \(BE\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{AD}\). Thus, \(BE\) is the height of the trapezoid.

Now, to find \(BE\), we'll use the Pythagorean theorem on right triangles \(BEC\) and \(AED\):

For \( \triangle BEC \):
\[ CE^2 = BC^2 - BE^2 \]

For \( \triangle AED \):
\[ DE^2 = AD^2 - BE^2 \]

Given that \(AB = 52\) and \(CD = 39\), \(CE + DE = 52 - 39 = 13\).

Now, applying the Pythagorean theorem to both triangles:

For \( \triangle BEC \):
\[ BE^2 = BC^2 - CE^2 \]
\[ BE^2 = 12^2 - CE^2 \]
\[ BE^2 = 144 - CE^2 \]

For \( \triangle AED \):
\[ BE^2 = AD^2 - DE^2 \]
\[ BE^2 = 5^2 - DE^2 \]
\[ BE^2 = 25 - DE^2 \]

Since \( CE + DE = 13 \), let's let \( CE = x \). Thus, \( DE = 13 - x \).

From \( \triangle BEC \):
\[ BE^2 = 144 - x^2 \]

From \( \triangle AED \):
\[ BE^2 = 25 - (13 - x)^2 \]

Setting them equal to each other:

\[ 144 - x^2 = 25 - (13 - x)^2 \]
\[ 144 - x^2 = 25 - (169 - 26x + x^2) \]
\[ 144 - x^2 = 25 - 169 + 26x - x^2 \]
\[ 144 - x^2 = -144 + 26x - x^2 \]

From the above, the \( x^2 \) terms cancel out. Solving for \( x \), we get:

\[ 26x = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

This means \( CE = 0 \) and \( DE = 13 \). However, \( CE = 0 \) doesn't make sense in the context of our trapezoid, which implies that \( BE \) is actually a straight vertical line that splits the trapezoid into two right triangles. Therefore, \( BE \) is the height of both triangles.

Using the Pythagorean theorem on \( \triangle AED \):
\[ BE^2 = 5^2 - 13^2 \]
\[ BE^2 = 25 - 169 \]
\[ BE^2 = -144 \]

Since \( BE^2 \) can't be negative, we must have made an error. Let's re-examine our approach.

The issue is our assumption that \( CE + DE = 13 \) based on the difference in lengths of the bases. This is not correct. \( CE + DE \) represents the horizontal difference, but we don't have enough information to determine \( CE \) and \( DE \) separately. 

Let's use a different approach.

Instead, drop a perpendicular from \( C \) to \( AB \), and call the point of intersection \( F \). \( CF \) will be the height of the trapezoid.

Then, \( \triangle CFB \) is similar to \( \triangle AED \) by AA similarity (both are right triangles and share angle \( C \)).

Using the properties of similar triangles:

\[ \frac{CF}{BE} = \frac{CB}{AD} \]
\[ CF = BE \times \frac{CB}{AD} \]
\[ CF = BE \times \frac{12}{5} \]
\[ CF = \frac{12}{5} BE \]

Since \( CF \) is the height of the trapezoid:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} (52 + 39) \times CF \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 91 \times \frac{12}{5} BE \]

Without knowing \( BE \), we cannot calculate the area.

However, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on \( \triangle AED \):

\[ BE^2 + 5^2 = 13^2 \]
\[ BE^2 = 169 - 25 \]
\[ BE^2 = 144 \]
\[ BE = 12 \]

Now, plugging this value into our formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 91 \times \frac{12}{5} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 91 \times \frac{144}{5} \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 91 \times 28.8 \]
\[ \text{Area} = 1311.6 \]

So, the area of \( ABCD \) is \( 1311.6 \) square units.

Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step:

**Step 1**: Observe the figure
The figure depicts a regular octagon with two intersecting diagonals which divide the octagon into various regions. We need to find the area of the shaded region.

**Step 2**: Find the length of the diagonal
Consider the octagon ABCDEFGH. Let's first find the length of the diagonal DH.
- Drop a perpendicular from D to AB. Let this intersect AB at M.
- Since the octagon is regular, AB = BC = 2 (given).
- By the Pythagorean theorem in triangle DMB (which is a 45-45-90 triangle), \(DM = \frac{AB}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}\).
- So, DH = 2 + 2(DM) = 2 + 2\(\sqrt{2}\).

**Step 3**: Calculate the area of triangle DQH
To find the area of the shaded region, we'll first find the area of triangle DQH and then subtract it twice from the area of rhombus DHQR.
- Height of triangle DQH = Half of side of octagon = 1
- Base of triangle DQH = DH = 2 + 2\(\sqrt{2}\)
- Area of triangle DQH = \(\frac{1}{2} \times (2 + 2\sqrt{2}) \times 1 = 1 + \sqrt{2}\).

**Step 4**: Calculate the area of rhombus DHQR
All sides of the rhombus are equal to the diagonal DH of the octagon.
- Area of rhombus = \( \frac{d1 \times d2}{2}\) where \(d1\) and \(d2\) are the diagonals of the rhombus.
- Here, \(d1 = DH\) and \(d2 = DH\). Thus, the area of the rhombus = \(\frac{DH \times DH}{2}\)
- Area = \(\frac{(2 + 2\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = \frac{4 + 8\sqrt{2} + 8}{2} = 6 + 4\sqrt{2}\).

**Step 5**: Calculate the area of the shaded region
Area of the shaded region = Area of rhombus DHQR - 2 x Area of triangle DQH.
- Area of the shaded region = \(6 + 4\sqrt{2}\) - 2(1 + \sqrt{2})
- Area of the shaded region = \(6 + 4\sqrt{2} - 2 - 2\sqrt{2}\)
- Area of the shaded region = \(4 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

So, the area of the shaded region is \(4 + 2\sqrt{2}\) square units.

Certainly! Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, note that the radius of the circle with center $R$ is 1 initially. Let's define the points of tangency of $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ with $\triangle ABC$ as $P'$, $Q'$, $R'$, and $S'$ respectively. 

**Step 1:** Determine the length of $BC$ initially.

By symmetry, the distance from $Q$ to the midpoint of $RS$ is 1 (because both are radii of the same circle). The length $R'S$ is 2 (since they are the centers of two tangential circles with a radius of 1). So, the length from $Q$ to $S$ is 3. $S'$ to $C$ is 1 (radius of circle $S$), and $B$ to $Q'$ is 1 (radius of circle $Q$).

Thus, $BC = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5$.

**Step 2:** The height of $\triangle ABC$ when extended from $B$.

The height from $B$ to the point of tangency with circle $P$, let's call it $X$, is composed of the radius of circle $Q$ (which

is 1) plus the distance from $Q$ to $P$. The distance from $Q$ to $P$ is twice the radius of circle $P$ (because $Q$ and $P$ are centers of two tangent circles), so this distance is 2.

Also, from the Pythagorean theorem, since $PQ$ is the hypotenuse of a 30-60-90 right triangle with shorter leg $QP' = 1$, we have: 

\[PQ^2 = 1^2 + (2\sqrt{3})^2\]
\[PQ^2 = 1 + 12\]
\[PQ = \sqrt{13}\]

So, $BX$ (height from base $BC$ to $X$) is:

\[BX = 1 + \sqrt{13}\]

The height from $X$ to $A$ is the radius of circle $P$, which is 1.

So, the total height of $\triangle ABC$ from $B$ to $A$ is:

\[BA = 1 + \sqrt{13} + 1 = \sqrt{13} + 2\]

**Step 3:** Changing the radius of circle $R$.

Let's call the new radius of circle $R$ as $r$. The distance from $R$ to the midpoint of $PS$ will now be $2-r$ (because $P$ has a radius of 1, and $R$ now has a radius of $r$). The distance from $R$ to $S$ remains 2.

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle formed by the centers $P$, $R$ and the midpoint of $RS$, we have:

\[PR^2 = (2-r)^2 + 1^2\]
\[PR^2 = 4 - 4r + r^2 + 1\]
\[PR^2 = r^2 - 4r + 5\]

But since $PR$ is the hypotenuse of a 30-60-90 right triangle, we know:

\[PR = 2\sqrt{3} \times r\]
\[PR = 2r\sqrt{3}\]

Equating and solving for $r$:

\[(2r\sqrt{3})^2 = r^2 - 4r + 5\]
\[12r^2 = r^2 - 4r + 5\]
\[11r^2 + 4r - 5 = 0\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]

\[r = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 220}}{22}\]
\[r = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{236}}{22}\]
\[r = \frac{-4 \pm 2\sqrt{59}}{22}\]
\[r = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{59}}{11}\]

Considering the circle is shrinking, we consider the minus sign:

\[r = \frac{-2 - \sqrt{59}}{11}\]
\[r = \frac{-2 + \sqrt{59}}{11}\]

The answer is in the form $\frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{c}$, so:

\[a+b+c = -2 + 59 + 11 = 68\]

Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Drawing the Radius**: Draw the radius of the semicircle that hits the tangent line at point \( F \). Since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of tangency, \( AF \) is perpendicular to \( CE \).

2. **Using Pythagoras in Triangle AFE**: 
The radius of the semicircle is half the diameter, i.e., half of side \( AB \). Since \( AB \) is 2 (given), the radius \( AF \) is 1. Now, triangle \( AFE \) is a right triangle (due to the property of the tangent). Let \( FE = x \). Therefore, \( AE = 2 - x \) (since \( AD = 2 \)).
Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle \( AFE \):
\[ AF^2 + FE^2 = AE^2 \]
\[ 1^2 + x^2 = (2 - x)^2 \]
\[ 1 + x^2 = 4 - 4x + x^2 \]
\[ 4x = 3 \]
\[ x = \frac{3}{4} \]

3. **Calculating Length of CE**: 
In right triangle \( CEF \), the length of \( CF \) is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) (since \( CF = CB + BF \) and \( BF = AF = 1 \)). Now, \( FE \) is \( \frac{3}{4} \) (from the previous step). 
Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle \( CEF \):
\[ CF^2 = CE^2 + FE^2 \]
\[ 3^2 = CE^2 + \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 \]
\[ 9 = CE^2 + \frac{9}{16} \]
\[ CE^2 = \frac{135}{16} \]
\[ CE = \frac{\sqrt{135}}{4} = \frac{3\sqrt{15}}{4} \]

Thus, the length of \( \overline{CE} \) is \( \frac{3\sqrt{15}}{4} \).

Alright! Let's find the area of the shaded region step by step:

**Step 1:** Find the area of the entire right triangle.
We can use the formula for the area of a triangle: 
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Given that the base is 6 and the hypotenuse is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height. Let's call the height \( h \).
\[ h^2 + 6^2 = 10^2 \]
\[ h^2 + 36 = 100 \]
\[ h^2 = 64 \]
\[ h = 8 \]

So, the height of the triangle is 8 cm.

Now, using the formula for the area:
\[ \text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Area of the triangle} = 24 \text{ square centimeters} \]

**Step 2:** Find the area of the rectangle that is inside the shaded region.
The length of the rectangle is 3 cm, and its width is the difference between the height of the entire triangle and the height of the smaller triangle inside it.

To find the height of the smaller triangle, we'll use the Pythagorean theorem again. This time, the base of the triangle is 3, and we'll call its height \( h_1 \).
\[ h_1^2 + 3^2 = 6^2 \]
\[ h_1^2 + 9 = 36 \]
\[ h_1^2 = 27 \]
\[ h_1 = 3\sqrt{3} \]

So, the width of the rectangle is:
\[ 8 - 3\sqrt{3} \]

Using the formula for the area of a rectangle:
\[ \text{Area of the rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{Area of the rectangle} = 3 \times (8 - 3\sqrt{3}) \]
\[ \text{Area of the rectangle} = 24 - 9\sqrt{3} \text{ square centimeters} \]

**Step 3:** Subtract the area of the rectangle from the area of the entire triangle to get the shaded area.
\[ \text{Shaded area} = 24 - (24 - 9\sqrt{3}) \]
\[ \text{Shaded area} = 9\sqrt{3} \text{ square centimeters} \]

Thus, the number of square centimeters in the shaded area is \( 9\sqrt{3} \) square centimeters.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

Given that $ABCD$ is a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal and the adjacent sides are perpendicular. Thus, $AB = BC = 16$ and $AD = DC$.

Given that $P$ is a point on $BC$ such that $BP = PT$, then $BP = 16 - PT$ (because the total length of $BC = 16$). And since $BP = PT$, we can infer that $PT = \frac{16}{2} = 8$. So, $TP = 8$.

Given that $\angle APD = 90^{\circ}$, we have $PD$ as the altitude from $P$ onto $AD$ for $\triangle APD$. Let's drop an altitude from $Q$ onto $PS$ to meet it at point $E$. 

Now, in right $\triangle APD$, we have:
\[ AP^2 = PD^2 + AD^2 \]

Using the Pythagoras theorem on $\triangle APE$ and $\triangle PQE$:

\[ AE^2 + PE^2 = 20^2 = 400 \]
\[ QE^2 + PE^2 = 25^2 = 625 \]

Subtracting the two, we get:
\[ QE^2 - AE^2 = 225 \]
\[ (QE + AE)(QE - AE) = 225 \]

Given that $AE + EQ = 25$, the value of $(QE + AE)$ is $25$. Thus,
\[ QE - AE = \frac{225}{25} = 9 \]
\[ AE = 25 - 9 = 16 \]
\[ PE = \sqrt{400 - 16^2} = \sqrt{144} = 12 \]

Now, $PD = PE + ED$.

Given that $TS$ is perpendicular to $BC$ and $BC$ is parallel to $AD$ (because ABCD is a rectangle), $TS$ is also perpendicular to $AD$. Thus, $TS$ is an altitude from $P$ onto $AD$. Therefore, $ED = PT = 8$ (since given $PT = BP$ and $BP = 8$).

\[ PD = PE + ED = 12 + 8 = 20 \]

But we already know that $PA = 20$. Thus, in $\triangle APD$, $PA = PD$. This means $\triangle APD$ is an isosceles right triangle.

Therefore, $AD = \sqrt{2} \times PA = \sqrt{2} \times 20 = 20\sqrt{2}$.

Now, $CD = AD = 20\sqrt{2}$. 

Given that $RA$ passes through $Q$, $QR + RD = CD$.

Thus, $QR + RD = 20\sqrt{2}$.

Given that $AD = CD$, the height of the rectangle $ABCD$ from $AD$ to $BC$ is equal to $AB = 16$. 

From the triangle similarity (Since the angles of $\triangle APD$ and $\triangle QRD$ are the same, the triangles are similar. Both are also right triangles.), the ratios of the corresponding sides are the same.

Thus, the ratio of the height of $\triangle APD$ to $\triangle ABCD$ (which is 16) is equal to the ratio of the height of $\triangle QRD$ to $\triangle QRD$ + $\triangle QPC$.

The height of $\triangle APD$ from $A$ to $PD$ is $16 - 12 = 4$.

Setting up the ratio, we get:

\[ \frac{4}{16} = \frac{height \ of \ \triangle QRD}{height \ of \ \triangle QRD + height \ of \ \triangle QPC} \]

Since $height \ of \ \triangle QPC = PT = 8$ and $height \ of \ \triangle QRD + height \ of \ \triangle QPC = 16$, we can solve for the height of $\triangle QRD$:

\[ \frac{4}{16} = \frac{height \ of \ \triangle QRD}{16} \]
\[ height \ of \ \triangle QRD = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

Thus, the length of $RD = AD - 4 = 20\sqrt{2} - 4$.

Substituting in $QR + RD = 20\sqrt{2}$, we get:

\[ QR = 4 \]

Therefore, $QR - RD = 4 - (20\sqrt{2} - 4) = 8 - 20\sqrt{2}$.

**Answer:**
\[ QR - RD = 8 - 20\sqrt{2} \]

To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem and some properties of similar triangles.

**Step 1:** Identify the triangles involved.
We can see that there are two right triangles formed here:
1. Triangle \(ABC\)
2. Triangle \(ACD\) where \(D\) is the point where fold \(l\) meets the bottom edge.

**Step 2:** Express the sides of triangle \(ABC\).
Given \(BC = 5\ inches\), and since \(AC\) is perpendicular to \(BC\), segment \(AC\) divides the rectangle into two parts. Let's call the longer portion \(AC = x\). Therefore, the shorter portion \(CD = 8 - x\).

**Step 3:** Use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle \(ABC\).
For triangle \(ABC\),
\[AB^2 = BC^2 + AC^2\]
\[AB^2 = 5^2 + x^2 = 25 + x^2\]

**Step 4:** Use properties of similar triangles.
Triangles \(ABC\) and \(ACD\) are similar because they both are right triangles and share angle \(ACB\).

So, we have the ratios:
\[\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AC}{CD}\]

**Step 5:** Substitute the expressions for the sides from step 3 and step 2 into the ratio from step 4.
\[ \frac{\sqrt{25 + x^2}}{x} = \frac{x}{8 - x} \]

**Step 6:** Solve for \(x\).
Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[ x \cdot \sqrt{25 + x^2} = x(8 - x) \]

Square both sides to get rid of the square root:
\[ x^2(25 + x^2) = x^2(8 - x)^2 \]
\[ 25x^2 + x^4 = 64x^2 - 16x^3 + x^4 \]

Combining like terms and simplifying:
\[ 39x^2 - 16x^3 = 0 \]

Factoring out \(x^2\):
\[ x^2(39 - 16x) = 0 \]
\[ x^2(16x - 39) = 0 \]

This gives \(x = 0\) or \(x = \frac{39}{16}\).

Since \(x = 0\) is not a valid length for segment \(AC\), we discard it. Thus, \(x = \frac{39}{16} = 2.4375\ inches\).

**Step 7:** Find the length of \(l\).
Using the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle \(ABC\):
\[ l^2 = 5^2 + 2.4375^2 \]
\[ l^2 = 25 + 5.9414 \]
\[ l^2 = 30.9414 \]
\[ l \approx 5.56\ inches \]

Therefore, the length of the fold \(l\) is approximately \(5.56\) inches.

2. Since the sum of the angles in triangle \( BAD \) is \( 180^\circ \), we can write:

\[ \angle BAD + \angle ABD + \angle BDA = 180^\circ \]

Given \( \angle BAD = \angle ABD \), the equation becomes:

\[ 2\angle BAD + \angle BDA = 180^\circ \]

Now, \( \angle BDA \) is an exterior angle to triangle \( ADC \). An exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the opposite interior angles. Hence, \( \angle BDA = \angle ACD + \angle ADC \).

Given that \( \angle ACD = 22.5^\circ \) and \( AD = DC \) (which means \( \angle ADC = \angle ACD \)), we can write:

\[ \angle BDA = 22.5^\circ + 22.5^\circ = 45^\circ \]

Substituting this value in the equation for triangle \( BAD \), we get:

\[ 2\angle BAD + 45^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2\angle BAD = 135^\circ \]
\[ \angle BAD = \frac{135^\circ}{2} = 67.5^\circ \]

3. We have found that \( \angle BAD = 67.5^\circ \). Now, to find \( \angle ABC \), we need to consider triangle \( ABC \). Since \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle BAD \) are supplementary (they are on a straight line), we can write:

\[ \angle ABC + 67.5^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 67.5^\circ = 112.5^\circ \]

Hence, the measure of angle \( ABC \) is \( 112.5^\circ \).

**Step 1:** Establish the relationship between triangles.
From the figure, we can deduce that $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle ADC$ are similar by the AA similarity criterion because they share angle $A$ and have a right angle at $D$ and $B$, respectively.

**Step 2:** Set up a proportion using similar triangles.
If the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. Let's use the sides that we know to find the ratio.

Let $x$ be the length of $AE$. Using the similarity:
\[\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{AB}{AC}\]
\[x/(x+10) = 5/15\]
\[x/(x+10) = 1/3\]

**Step 3:** Solve for x.
Multiplying through by 3(x+10):
\[3x = x + 10\]
\[2x = 10\]
\[x = 5\]
So, $AE = 5$ units.

**Step 4:** Find the height of triangle $ABE$.
Since $AE$ is 5 units and $AD$ is a total of 15 units (5 for $AF$ and 10 for $FD$), the length $DE$ is 10 units. 

Now, using the Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle ABE$:
\[AB^2 + BE^2 = AE^2\]
\[5^2 + BE^2 = 5^2\]
\[BE^2 = 0\]
\[BE = 0\]
That is, point $E$ coincides with point $B$. This means $\triangle ABE$ doesn't exist as a separate entity from line segment $AB$.

**Conclusion:**
The area of $\triangle ABE$ is $0$ square units because point $E$ coincides with point $B$.

To determine the area of $\triangle UXP$, we will use properties of triangles and ratios.

Since $P$ is the point of intersection of the cevians $UY$, $VZ$, and $WX$, and $VY:YW=4:3$, we know that the areas of triangles with the same height are proportional to their bases.

Step 1: Determining the ratio for $\triangle PYW$ and $\triangle PVY$.

Given, $VY:YW=4:3$. So, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle PVY$ to $\triangle PYW$ is also 4:3. This means:

Area($\triangle PVY$) = $\frac{4}{3}$ * Area($\triangle PYW$)

Given that Area($\triangle PYW$) = 30, we find:

Area($\triangle PVY$) = $\frac{4}{3}$ * 30 = 40

Step 2: Using the above ratio to determine Area($\triangle PZW$) and Area($\triangle PVZ$).

We know:
Area($\triangle PZW$) = 35

Thus, Area($\triangle PVZ$) + Area($\triangle PZW$) = Area($\triangle VZP$)

Area($\triangle VZP$) = 35 + 40 = 75

So, Area($\triangle PVZ$) = Area($\triangle VZP$) - Area($\triangle PZW$)
Area($\triangle PVZ$) = 75 - 35 = 40

Step 3: Using ratios to find Area($\triangle UXP$).

We can set up a ratio with the given areas:
Area($\triangle PVY$):Area($\triangle PYW$):Area($\triangle PZW$) = Area($\triangle PVX$):Area($\triangle UXP$):Area($\triangle UZP$)

Given the areas for $\triangle PYW$ and $\triangle PZW$, and knowing Area($\triangle PVX$) = 40, we can fill in what we know:
40:30:35 = 40:Area($\triangle UXP$):Area($\triangle UZP$)

From this, we know the area of $\triangle UZP$ and $\triangle UXP$ are the same (since their corresponding areas on the other side of the ratio are the same).

Therefore, Area($\triangle UXP$) = Area($\triangle UZP$) = Area($\triangle PVZ$) = 40

So, the area of $\triangle UXP$ is **40**.

Given that segment \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle and measures 4 cm, the radius \( r \) of the circle is half of this:
\[ r = \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{4 \text{ cm}}{2} = 2 \text{ cm} \]

The area \( A \) of a circle with radius \( r \) is given by the formula:
\[ A = \pi r^2 \]
Using this formula:
\[ A = \pi (2 \text{ cm})^2 = 4\pi \text{ cm}^2 \]

2. **Calculate the area of triangle \( ABC \):**

To determine the area of triangle \( ABC \), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Since \( AB \) is a diameter of the circle, and \( C \) is a point on the circle, triangle \( ABC \) is a right triangle with \( AC \) as the hypotenuse.

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle \( ABC \):
\[ AC^2 = AB^2 - BC^2 \]
\[ AC^2 = (4 \text{ cm})^2 - (2 \text{ cm})^2 = 16 \text{ cm}^2 - 4 \text{ cm}^2 = 12 \text{ cm}^2 \]
\[ AC = \sqrt{12 \text{ cm}^2} = 2\sqrt{3} \text{ cm} \]

Now, using \( AB \) as the base of the triangle:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times AC \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \text{ cm} \times 2\sqrt{3} \text{ cm} \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = 4\sqrt{3} \text{ cm}^2 \]

3. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**

The shaded region is the area of the circle minus the area of triangle \( ABC \):
\[ \text{Shaded Area} = 4\pi \text{ cm}^2 - 4\sqrt{3} \text{ cm}^2 \]

Using the approximate value of \( \pi \) as 3.14, the shaded area becomes:
\[ \text{Shaded Area} \approx 12.56 \text{ cm}^2 - 4\sqrt{3} \text{ cm}^2 \]

Thus, the area of the shaded region is approximately \( 12.56 \text{ cm}^2 - 4\sqrt{3} \text{ cm}^2 \).

We first note a few properties of the orthocenter. If $H$ is the orthocenter of triangle $ABC$, and $D$, $E$, and $F$ are the feet of the altitudes from $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, then:
- $HA$ is the altitude of triangle $BHC$ from $H$.
- $HB$ is the altitude of triangle $AHC$ from $H$.
- $HC$ is the altitude of triangle $AHB$ from $H$.
- $HD$ is perpendicular to $BC$.
- $HE$ is perpendicular to $AC$.
- $HF$ is perpendicular to $AB$.

The orthocenter $H$ has an interesting property with respect to the sides of triangle $ABC$. Specifically, the three segments $BH$, $CH$, and $AH$ are called the cevians of triangle $ABC$. These cevians divide the sides of the triangle into six segments. The cevians from the three vertices to the orthocenter are called the altitudes, and they satisfy the relation:
\[BD \cdot DC = BE \cdot EC = BF \cdot FA.\]
This is known as the "equal products of lengths" property for the orthocenter.

Using the information given, we have:
\[BD \cdot DC = 5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[BE \cdot EC = BE \cdot \left(\frac{42}{5}\right) = 42.\]

So, we see that $BE \cdot EC$ does not equal $BD \cdot DC$. This means that the orthocenter $H$ does not lie on segment $BE$.

Next, let's examine triangle $BHC$. Since $HA$ is the altitude of triangle $BHC$, and it passes through $D$, we have:
\[HD = DH' = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BH\]
where $H'$ is the reflection of $H$ over line $BC$.

From the property of the orthocenter, $HC$ is the altitude of triangle $AHB$, and it passes through $F$, so:
\[HF = FH' = \frac{1}{2} \cdot HC\]
where $H'$ is the reflection of $H$ over line $AB$.

Using the information about $BC$ and $AC$ and their lengths, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the lengths of $BH$ and $CH$. Once we have those lengths, we can use them to determine $HD$ and $HF$.

Finally, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to determine the length of $HE$ using triangle $HBE$.

Let's proceed step by step:

1. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find $BC$:
\[BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2 = 5^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 81 = 106\]
\[BC = \sqrt{106}\]

2. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find $BE$:
\[BE^2 = BD^2 + DE^2\]
Given that $BD = 5$ and $DE = AC - CE = AC - \frac{42}{5}$, we can express $BE$ in terms of $AC$:
\[BE^2 = 5^2 + (AC - \frac{42}{5})^2\]
\[BE = \sqrt{25 + AC^2 - \frac{84}{5}AC + \frac{1764}{25}}\]

3. Using the property of the orthocenter, we have:
\[BE \cdot EC = 45\]
Substituting the value of $EC$ and the expression for $BE$, we get:
\[\sqrt{25 + AC^2 - \frac{84}{5}AC + \frac{1764}{25}} \cdot \frac{42}{5} = 45\]
This will give us the value of $AC$.

4. Once we have $AC$, we can find $DE$, and then use the Pythagorean theorem to determine $BH$.

5. Using the relationship $HD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BH$, we can find $HD$.

6. Finally, use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $HBE$ to determine $HE$:
\[HE^2 = BH^2 - BE^2\]

The above steps will lead you to the answer for $HE$. This problem requires some calculations, but by following the steps, you can arrive at the solution.

Sure, let's calculate the total surface area of the solid.

The solid consists of:
1. A semicircular base
2. A rectangle (which is half the lateral surface of the original cylinder)
3. Half of the top circular face of the original cylinder.

### 1. Area of the semicircular base:
The area of a full circle is given by \( \pi r^2 \).
So, the area of a semicircle (half a circle) is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \]

Given \( r = 6 \text{ cm} \), the area of the semicircular base is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \pi (6^2) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2} \pi \times 36 \]
\[ = 18\pi \text{ cm}^2 \]

### 2. Area of the rectangle:
The rectangle is formed by cutting the curved surface of the cylinder in half. The length of the rectangle is the height of the cylinder, and the breadth of the rectangle is half the circumference of the base of the cylinder.

The circumference of a full circle is \( 2\pi r \). So, half of it is \( \pi r \).
Given \( r = 6 \text{ cm} \) and height \( h = 10 \text{ cm} \), the area of the rectangle is:
\[ \pi \times 6 \times 10 \]
\[ = 60\pi \text{ cm}^2 \]

### 3. Area of half the top circular face:
This is the same as the area of the semicircular base, which is:
\[ 18\pi \text{ cm}^2 \]

Now, adding up all the areas:
\[ 18\pi + 60\pi + 18\pi \]
\[ = 96\pi \text{ cm}^2 \]

Therefore, the total surface area of the solid, in terms of \( \pi \), is \( 96\pi \text{ cm}^2 \).

Sure! Let's tackle the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Visualizing the prism**

The prism has six rectangular faces (non-hexagonal) that are connected to the hexagonal bases. Each of these faces will have a width equal to the edge length of the hexagon and a height equal to the height of the prism.

**Step 2: Calculating the area of one rectangular face**

To determine the area of one of these faces:
- The width is given as 6 inches, which is equal to 0.5 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot).
- The height of the prism is given as 3 feet.

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is found by multiplying its width \( w \) by its height \( h \):
\[ A = w \times h \]
\[ A = 0.5 \text{ ft} \times 3 \text{ ft} \]
\[ A = 1.5 \text{ ft}^2 \]

**Step 3: Calculating the combined area of all six rectangular faces**

Since there are six of these faces and they're all identical:
\[ \text{Total area} = 6 \times \text{area of one face} \]
\[ \text{Total area} = 6 \times 1.5 \text{ ft}^2 \]
\[ \text{Total area} = 9 \text{ ft}^2 \]

So, the sum of the areas of the non-hexagonal faces of the prism is \( 9 \text{ ft}^2 \).

Alright, let's approach this step by step.

1. **Finding the area of the squares**: 
Each square is $4\times 4$, so the area of one square is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) square units. Since there are two squares, the combined area is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) square units.

2. **Finding the overlapping area**: 
Notice that each of the squares contributes half of the overlapping square's area. To find this overlapping area, we can take a quarter of one of the squares and multiply by 2. This is because the overlap region is made up of two right triangles from each square, and these triangles together form a square of side length \(4/2 = 2\). Thus, the overlapping area is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) square units.

3. **Subtracting the overlapping area from the combined area of the squares**:
We must subtract this overlapping area since we've counted it twice (once for each square). 
So, \(32 - 4 = 28\) square units is the area of the shaded region without the circle subtracted.

4. **Finding the area of the circle**: 
We know that the circle's diameter is the same as the side length of the overlapping square (from step 2), which is 2 units. The radius is half of that, or 1 unit. The area of the circle is \(\pi r^2\). Plugging in our radius, the circle's area is \(\pi(1^2) = \pi\) square units.

5. **Subtracting the circle's area from the shaded region**: 
Finally, subtract the circle's area from the 28 square units we found in step 3. 

\[ 28 - \pi \] 

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\), this is approximately \(28 - 3.14 = 24.86\).

So, the area of the shaded region created by removing the circle from the squares is approximately \(24.86\) square units.

Alright, let's start by marking down what we know:

Given:
1. $AB = 8$ 
2. $BC = AD = 9$ (since it's a rectangle)
3. $BH = 6$, so $HC = 9 - 6 = 3$
4. $DE = 4$, so $DA = 9 - 4 = 5$

Since $\overline{GF} \perp \overline{AF}$, $\triangle GAF$ is a right triangle with right angle at $F$.

To find $GF$, we can use similar triangles. 

We can first look at the larger triangle, $\triangle GBA$. 

$\triangle GBA$ ~ $\triangle GDE$ because of the shared angle at G and the right angles at B and D.

Setting up the ratio for the similar sides of these triangles:

\[\frac{GB}{GD} = \frac{BA}{DE}\]

Given that $BA = 8$ and $DE = 4$, we get:

\[\frac{GB}{GD} = 2\]

Let's call the length of $GD$ as $x$. So, $GB = 2x$.

Now, using the fact that $\overline{GF} \perp \overline{AF}$ and the properties of a rectangle, we can see that:

$AH$ is the diagonal of rectangle $ABCD$ and hence splits the rectangle into two right triangles, $\triangle AHD$ and $\triangle AHB$.

Now, using the Pythagorean theorem for $\triangle AHB$:

\[AH^2 = AB^2 + BH^2\]
\[AH^2 = 8^2 + 6^2\]
\[AH^2 = 64 + 36\]
\[AH^2 = 100\]
\[AH = 10\]

Similarly, for $\triangle AHD$:

\[AH^2 = AD^2 + DH^2\]
\[AH^2 = 9^2 + 3^2\]
\[AH^2 = 81 + 9\]
\[AH^2 = 90\]

This shows a contradiction as the lengths of diagonal $AH$ calculated from the two triangles are different.

However, let's continue to find the length of $GF$ assuming the given information is accurate.

From the similar triangles, $\triangle GBA$ and $\triangle GDE$:

\[GD + DE = GB\]
\[x + 4 = 2x\]
\[x = 4\]

This means $GD = 4$. Now, using the properties of a rectangle, $FD = DA = 5$.

The length of $GF$ will be $GF = GD - FD = 4 - 5 = -1$.

However, this result is non-sensical as we cannot have a negative length.

Given this inconsistency and contradiction, it seems there might be an error or oversight in the provided information or diagram.

Alright! Let's solve this step-by-step.

**Step 1:** Since $AC = AB$, triangle $ABC$ is isosceles. Thus, the measure of $\angle BCA = \angle BAC = 42$ degrees.

**Step 2:** Remember that the angles in any triangle sum to 180 degrees. This means:

$\angle ABC = 180 - (\angle BAC + \angle BCA) = 180 - (42 + 42) = 96$ degrees.

**Step 3:** The arc intercepted by an inscribed angle is twice the measure of that angle. Therefore, arc $BC$ is $2 \times 96 = 192$ degrees.

**Step 4:** A tangent line intersects the circle's circumference at a right angle to the radius drawn to that point of tangency. Thus, $\angle ECD = 90$ degrees.

**Step 5:** We know that the angle formed by a chord and a tangent line is half the measure of the arc cut off by that chord. In this case, $\angle ACD$ is half the measure of arc $ABC$.

$\angle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{arc } ABC$

Arc $ABC = 360 - \text{arc } BC = 360 - 192 = 168$ degrees.

Thus, $\angle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times 168 = 84$ degrees.

So, the measure of angle $ACD$ is $\boxed{84}$ degrees.

Let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to $BC$, $E$ to $AC$, and $F$ to $AB$. 

Now, let's use the Pythagorean Theorem:
$BD^2 + PD^2 = 7^2$
$CD^2 + PD^2 = 6^2$
$BF^2 + PF^2 = 7^2$
$AF^2 + PF^2 = 11^2$
$AE^2 + PE^2 = 11^2$
$CE^2 + PE^2 = 6^2$

Notice that $BF = BD$ (because they both equal $BC - BD$) and $AE = AF$ (because they both equal $AC - AF$). This allows us to subtract the third equation from the first, and the fifth equation from the fourth, which gives:
$PD^2 - PF^2 = BD^2 - BF^2 = 2BD^2 - s^2$
$PE^2 - PF^2 = AE^2 - AF^2 = 2AE^2 - s^2$

From the second and sixth equations:
$PD^2 - PE^2 = CD^2 - CE^2 = 2CE^2 - s^2$

Adding the two results above, we get:
$2PD^2 - 2PF^2 = 2BD^2 + 2CE^2 - 2s^2$
or
$PD^2 - PF^2 = BD^2 + CE^2 - s^2$

But since $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, $BD^2 + CE^2 = s^2$. Plugging this in, we get:
$PD^2 - PF^2 = 0$
or $PD = PF$

But since $PD + PF = 13$, each must be $6.5$. 

Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $BPD$:
$BD^2 + 6.5^2 = 7^2$
$BD^2 = 7^2 - 6.5^2 = 48.5 - 42.25 = 6.25$
$BD = 2.5$

So, $BC = 2(BD) = 5$. 

Now, use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $ABC$:
$s^2 + 5^2 = s^2 + 25$
$s^2 = 25 + 25 = 50$
$s = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{25 + 50\sqrt{2}}$

When reflecting a point across the \(x\)-axis, the \(x\)-coordinate remains the same, but the sign of the \(y\)-coordinate changes.

Alright! To determine how many more inches point B travels than point A when the card is opened to an angle of 45 degrees, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1:** We first need to determine the radius of the circle that point A and point B will be on. Since the card is rotating about the fold, and point A is 3 inches from the fold, the radius of this circle is 3 inches.

**Step 2:** The angle that the card is opened is 45 degrees, which is 1/8th of a full circle (since \( 360^{\circ} \div 45^{\circ} = 8 \)). 

**Step 3:** The circumference of a circle with a radius \( r \) is \( 2\pi r \). Point A, being 3 inches from the fold, will travel \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the circumference of a circle with a radius of 3 inches, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 2\pi(3) = \frac{3\pi}{4} \]
So, point A travels \( \frac{3\pi}{4} \) inches.

**Step 4:** Point B is on the outer edge of the card, so it's traveling on a circle with a radius that is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one side of 3 inches (the same as the radius of the circle point A is on) and another side of 8 inches (the height of the card).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ r^2 = 3^2 + 8^2 = 9 + 64 = 73 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{73} \]

**Step 5:** Point B will travel \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the circumference of a circle with radius \( \sqrt{73} \), which is:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 2\pi \sqrt{73} = \frac{\pi \sqrt{73}}{4} \]

**Step 6:** To determine how much further point B travels than point A, we'll subtract the distance point A travels from the distance point B travels:
\[ \frac{\pi \sqrt{73}}{4} - \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi (\sqrt{73} - 3)}{4} \]

So, point B travels \( \frac{\pi (\sqrt{73} - 3)}{4} \) inches further than point A when the card is opened to an angle of 45 degrees.

Step 1: Identify known ratios in a 30-60-90 triangle.

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of $1:\sqrt{3}:2$. Let's denote the length of $AC$ (the hypotenuse) as $2x$. Then, side $BC$ (opposite the 60-degree angle) will have a length of $x\sqrt{3}$, and side $AB$ (opposite the 30-degree angle) will have a length of $x$.

Step 2: Calculate the height of each triangle.

Using triangle $ABC$, $AD$ (which is the height of triangle $ADC$ from base $AC$) will also be the height of triangle $BDC$ from base $BC$. Since $ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, we can determine that:
\[ AD = AC - AB \]
\[ AD = 2x - x = x \]

Step 3: Calculate the areas of triangles $BDC$ and $ADC$.

Area of a triangle = $\frac{1}{2} \times$ base $\times$ height.

For triangle $BDC$ (using $BC$ as the base):
\[ \text{Area}_{BDC} = \frac{1}{2} \times x\sqrt{3} \times x = \frac{1}{2}x^2\sqrt{3} \]

For triangle $ADC$ (using $AC$ as the base):
\[ \text{Area}_{ADC} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2x \times x = x^2 \]

Step 4: Determine the ratio of the areas.

\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Area}_{BDC}}{\text{Area}_{ADC}} \]
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}x^2\sqrt{3}}{x^2} \]
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

So, the ratio of the area of triangle $BDC$ to the area of triangle $ADC$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.

4. **Angle $GCE$**:
   - Now, to find angle $GCE$, consider the angles that make up the straight line $GC$. We know that angles on a straight line sum up to $180^\circ$. We have:
     - The right angle $GCB$ which is $90^\circ$.
     - Angle $EBC$ which is $30^\circ$.
     - And the angle we are trying to find, $GCE$.
   - Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2L + 2(2L) = 176 \]
\[ 2L + 4L = 176 \]
Combining like terms:
\[ 6L = 176 \]
Divide both sides by 6:
\[ L = \frac{176}{6} \]
\[ L = 29.33 \]

3. **Find \( W \):**
\[ W = 2(29.33) \]
\[ W = 58.66 \]

4. **Find the dimensions of one of the five congruent rectangles:**
From the given diagram, one congruent rectangle has a length equal to half the width of the large rectangle and a width equal to the length of the large rectangle. Thus:
\[ L_{congruent} = \frac{W}{2} = 29.33 \]
\[ W_{congruent} = L = 29.33 \]

5. **Find the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles:**
\[ Perimeter = 2L_{congruent} + 2W_{congruent} \]
\[ Perimeter = 2(29.33) + 2(29.33) \]
\[ Perimeter = 117.32 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is \( 117.32 \) units.

Let's begin by analyzing the problem.

We are given:
- Triangle \( ABC \) with \( \angle B = 90^\circ \), so it's a right triangle.
- \( D \) and \( E \) lie on \( AC \) with \( BD \) being a median and \( BE \) being an altitude.
- \( BD = 2 \cdot DE \).

We want to find:
- The ratio \( \frac{AB}{EC} \).

Now, let's use the given information to set up some relationships.

Step 1: 
Since \( BD \) is a median to side \( AC \), \( AD = DC \). Let's call both of these lengths \( x \). Therefore, \( AC = 2x \).

Step 2: 
Since \( BE \) is an altitude from the right angle, the area of \( ABC \) can be represented in two ways:
1) \( \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times BE \)
2) \( \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times BC \).

Using the relation \( BD = 2 \cdot DE \), we can represent \( BE \) in terms of \( DE \) as \( BE = 3 \cdot DE \).

Step 3:
By using the fact that triangles with the same height have areas proportional to their bases, the area of \( ABD \) can be represented as:
\[ \text{Area of } ABD = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times DE \]
And the area of \( ABD \) can also be written in terms of \( ABC \) as:
\[ \text{Area of } ABD = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Area of } ABC \]
This is because the median divides the triangle into two triangles of equal area.

Step 4:
Setting the two expressions for the area of \( ABD \) equal to each other, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times DE = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times (3 \times DE) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ AB \times DE = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times 3DE \]
And further:
\[ DE = \frac{3}{2}DE \]
Which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption that \( AD = DC \) is incorrect. 

Step 5:
Since \( BD = 2DE \), the length \( BD \) is two-thirds the length of \( BE \) (because \( BE = 3DE \)). Thus, \( AD \) is two-thirds the length of \( AC \) and \( DC \) is one-third the length of \( AC \). This means:
\[ AD = \frac{2}{3} AC \]
\[ DC = \frac{1}{3} AC \]

Step 6:
Using Pythagoras theorem in triangle \( ABD \):
\[ AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 \]
Given \( BD = 2DE \) and \( DE = \frac{1}{3} AC \):
\[ BD = \frac{2}{3} AC \]
Substituting the values in, we get:
\[ AB^2 = \left( \frac{2}{3} AC \right)^2 + \left( \frac{2}{3} AC \right)^2 \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ AB^2 = \frac{8}{9} AC^2 \]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ AB = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} AC \]

Step 7:
Using similar reasoning in triangle \( BEC \):
\[ EC^2 = BE^2 - BC^2 \]
Since \( BE = 3DE \) and \( DE = \frac{1}{3} AC \):
\[ BE = AC \]
\[ BC = AB - AC = AB - BE = AB - \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} AC \]
Substituting the values in:
\[ EC^2 = AC^2 - \left( AB - \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} AC \right)^2 \]
From the earlier steps, we know:
\[ AB = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} AC \]
Substituting this in and solving for \( EC \) gives:
\[ EC = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} AC \]

Step 8:
Finally, taking the ratio:
\[ \frac{AB}{EC} = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} AC}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} AC} = 2 \]

Therefore, the ratio \( \frac{AB}{EC} \) is \( 2 \).

Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

Given:
1. Each triangle is an isosceles right triangle.
2. The length of \( \overline{BC} \) is 2 units.

An isosceles right triangle has angles 45°, 45°, and 90°. The two legs are congruent.

Let's start by finding the length of \( \overline{AB} \):
1. Because triangle \( ABC \) is an isosceles right triangle, \( \overline{AB} \) is congruent to \( \overline{BC} \). Thus, \( \overline{AB} \) is also 2 units.

Next, we find the length of \( \overline{AD} \):
1. Notice that triangle \( ABD \) is also an isosceles right triangle.
2. The hypotenuse of this triangle is \( \overline{AB} \), which is 2 units.
3. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find that the legs (which are congruent) of this triangle are \( \sqrt{2} \) units each.
Thus, \( \overline{AD} \) is \( \sqrt{2} \) units.

Now, \( \overline{CD} \) is the sum of \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{AD} \):
1. \( \overline{CD} \) = 2 units + \( \sqrt{2} \) units = 2 + \( \sqrt{2} \) units.

Lastly, \( \overline{CB} \) is the hypotenuse of the larger isosceles right triangle \( ACD \):
1. If we use the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find that \( \overline{CB} \) = \( \sqrt{\overline{CD}^2 + \overline{AD}^2} \).
2. \( \overline{CB} \) = \( \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (\sqrt{2})^2} \)
3. \( \overline{CB} \) = \( \sqrt{6 + 4\sqrt{2}} \)

The perimeter of quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is the sum of the lengths of its sides:
Perimeter = \( \overline{AB} \) + \( \overline{BC} \) + \( \overline{CD} \) + \( \overline{DA} \)
Perimeter = 2 + 2 + 2 + \( \sqrt{2} \) + \( \sqrt{2} \) + \( \sqrt{6 + 4\sqrt{2}} \)

After combining like terms:
Perimeter = 6 + 2\( \sqrt{2} \) + \( \sqrt{6 + 4\sqrt{2}} \) units.

And that's your answer! The perimeter of quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is 6 + 2\( \sqrt{2} \) + \( \sqrt{6 + 4\sqrt{2}} \) units.

To find the area of the shaded region, we'll first determine the area of the large semicircle and then subtract the areas of the three smaller semicircles.

**Step 1:** Find the area of the large semicircle.
The radius of the large semicircle is 2. Therefore, its area is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2^2) = 2\pi \]

**Step 2:** Find the area of one of the smaller semicircles.
The radius of each smaller semicircle is 1. Therefore, the area of one of the smaller semicircles is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (1^2) = \frac{1}{2}\pi \]

**Step 3:** Find the total area of the three smaller semicircles.
Since there are three smaller semicircles, the combined area of the three is:
\[ 3 \times \frac{1}{2}\pi = \frac{3}{2}\pi \]

**Step 4:** Subtract the area of the three smaller semicircles from the area of the large semicircle.
\[ 2\pi - \frac{3}{2}\pi = \frac{4\pi - 3\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{2} \]

Therefore, the area of the shaded region is \( \boxed{\frac{\pi}{2}} \).

Let's break this problem down step by step.

**Step 1: Setting up the problem**

The figure consists of two squares $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ with equal areas. We can label the side length of each square as $s$. Therefore, the area of each square is $s^2$.

**Step 2: Analyzing the shaded regions**

We have two shaded triangles. One is triangle $ACD$ and the other is triangle $HCG$. 

**Step 3: Finding the area of triangle $ACD$**

Triangle $ACD$ is a right triangle with $AD$ and $CD$ as its legs. Therefore, its area is $\frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times s = \frac{1}{2} s^2$.

**Step 4: Finding the area of triangle $HCG$**

Triangle $HCG$ is also a right triangle. We know $GH$ is $s$ (since it's a side of the square), and since $J$ is the midpoint of $GH$, segment $GJ = \frac{s}{2}$.

The hypotenuse $HC$ of triangle $HCG$ is an extension of diagonal $AC$ of the first square. Since the diagonals of a square are equal in length and bisect each other, $AC = s\sqrt{2}$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $ACH$, we have:

$AH^2 + CH^2 = AC^2$

$AH^2 + s^2 = 2s^2$

$AH^2 = s^2$

$AH = s$

So, the height of triangle $HCG$ is $s - \frac{s}{2} = \frac{s}{2}$.

The area of triangle $HCG$ is then $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{s}{2} \times \frac{s}{2} = \frac{1}{8} s^2$.

**Step 5: Finding the total shaded area**

The total shaded area is $\frac{1}{2} s^2 + \frac{1}{8} s^2 = \frac{5}{8} s^2$.

**Step 6: Calculating the fraction of the two squares that is shaded**

The combined area of the two squares is $2s^2$. Therefore, the fraction of the area that is shaded is:

$\frac{\frac{5}{8} s^2}{2s^2} = \frac{5}{16}$.

Thus, the fraction of the two squares that is shaded is $\boxed{\frac{5}{16}}$.

Alright, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Calculating the Area of $\triangle XYZ$**:
Given that $\triangle XYZ$ is an isosceles triangle with base $XZ = 30$ and two equal sides of length $17$, let's calculate its area.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $XZ$. Then, $XM = \frac{30}{2} = 15$.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem for right triangle $XMY$:

\[YM^2 = XY^2 - XM^2 = 17^2 - 15^2 = 289 - 225 = 64\]

\[YM = 8\]

Thus, the area of $\triangle XYZ$ is:

\[Area = \frac{1}{2} \times base \times height = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times 8 = 120\]

Which confirms that the area of $\triangle XYZ$ is indeed $120$ as given.

2. **Finding the Second Isosceles Triangle**:
For the second isosceles triangle, let's assume it has a base of $b$ and two equal sides of length $s$. Its height would be $h$.

Using the formula for the area of a triangle:

\[Area = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = 120\]
\[b \times h = 240\] ... (1)

Also, using the Pythagorean Theorem:

\[\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 + h^2 = s^2\] ... (2)

We are looking for integer side lengths. Given the first triangle had a large base and smaller equal sides, it's logical to think the second triangle might have a smaller base and larger equal sides.

If the base was $24$, from equation (1), the height would be $10$. Plugging into equation (2):

\[s^2 = 12^2 + 10^2 = 244\]

This is not a perfect square, so $b$ cannot be $24$.

If the base was $20$, from equation (1), the height would be $12$. Plugging into equation (2):

\[s^2 = 10^2 + 12^2 = 244\]

Again, this isn't a perfect square.

If the base was $16$, from equation (1), the height would be $15$. Plugging into equation (2):

\[s^2 = 8^2 + 15^2 = 64 + 225 = 289\]

This is a perfect square, $s = 17$.

3. **Conclusion**:
The second isosceles triangle has a base of $16$ and two equal sides of length $17$.

So, the perimeter of the second triangle is:

\[Perimeter = 16 + 17 + 17 = 50\]

Therefore, the perimeter of the second isosceles triangle with integer side lengths and an area of $120$ is $\boxed{50}$.

Certainly, let's break it down step by step.

1. The entire square is divided into 4 smaller congruent squares due to the diagonals. 
2. The shaded region appears to be in the top-right square.
3. Observing the top-right square, it looks like the shaded region is half of this square.
4. Since one of the smaller squares is 1/4 of the entire square, half of this square would be half of 1/4, which is 1/8.
5. Therefore, the shaded area is 1/8 of the entire square.

Answer: The shaded area is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the square's area.
