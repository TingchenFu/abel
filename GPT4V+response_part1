Alright! Let's solve this step by step.

**Step 1:** Understand the given information.
We're given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle A\) being the right angle. Also, we're given that \(\cos B = \frac{6}{10}\).

**Step 2:** Relate cosine to the sides of the triangle.
Recall the definition of cosine in a right triangle:
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In this case, for \(\angle B\), the adjacent side is \(AC\) and the hypotenuse is \(BC\). Using the given information:
\[
\cos B = \frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{6}{10}
\]

**Step 3:** Find the length of side \(AC\).
Using the relationship given:
\[ 
AC = \frac{6}{10} \times BC = 0.6 \times 10 = 6 \text{ units}
\]

**Step 4:** Use the Pythagorean theorem to find side \(AB\).
The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[ 
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]
Where \(a\) and \(b\) are the two legs of the right triangle and \(c\) is the hypotenuse.

Here, \(a = AC = 6 \text{ units}\), \(b = AB\) (which we need to find), and \(c = BC = 10 \text{ units}\).

Plugging in the known values:
\[ 
6^2 + AB^2 = 10^2
\]
\[ 
36 + AB^2 = 100
\]
\[ 
AB^2 = 64
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ 
AB = 8 \text{ units}
\]

**Step 5:** Find \(\tan C\).
Recall the definition of tangent in a right triangle:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\]
For \(\angle C\), the opposite side is \(AC\) and the adjacent side is \(AB\). Using the values we've found:
\[
\tan C = \frac{AC}{AB} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

**Answer:** \(\tan C = \frac{3}{4}\).

To find \(\cos{C}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of side \(AC\).
2. Use the given value of \(\cos{B}\) to find the length of side \(BC\).
3. Use the definition of cosine to find \(\cos{C}\).

**Step 1:** Find the length of side \(AC\).
Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2\]

Given that \(AB = 9\) and \(\cos{B} = \frac{3}{5}\), we have:
\[BC = \frac{AB}{\cos{B}}\]
\[BC = \frac{9}{\frac{3}{5}} = 9 \times \frac{5}{3} = 15\]

Now, \(AC^2 = BC^2 - AB^2\)
\[AC^2 = 15^2 - 9^2\]
\[AC^2 = 225 - 81\]
\[AC^2 = 144\]
\[AC = 12\]

**Step 2:** Use the given value of \(\cos{B}\) to find the length of side \(BC\).
\[BC = \frac{AB}{\cos{B}}\]
\[BC = \frac{9}{\frac{3}{5}} = 15\] (As found in Step 1)

**Step 3:** Use the definition of cosine to find \(\cos{C}\).
\[ \cos{C} = \frac{AB}{BC} \]
\[ \cos{C} = \frac{9}{15} \]
\[ \cos{C} = \frac{3}{5} \]

So, \(\cos{C} = \frac{3}{5}\).

To find the area of \( \triangle ABC \), we'll make use of the formula for the area of a triangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

1. **Identifying the Base and Height**:
    - The base of the triangle is \( BC \). Since the coordinates of \( B \) are \( (0,0) \) and \( C \) are \( (12,0) \), the length of \( BC \) is simply the difference in the x-coordinates: \( 12 - 0 = 12 \) units.
    - The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the vertex \( A \) to the base \( BC \). This height is the y-coordinate of \( A \), which is 9 units.

2. **Computing the Area**:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 9 \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 108 \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = 54 \] square units.

Thus, the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is \( 54 \) square units.

Sure!

Step 1: Identify the given sides in the right triangle.
We are given:
Adjacent side (side next to angle X excluding the hypotenuse) = 8 units
Opposite side (side opposite to angle X) = Not given
Hypotenuse = 10 units

Step 2: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side.
The formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:
\[ \text{Adjacent side}^2 + \text{Opposite side}^2 = \text{Hypotenuse}^2 \]

Given that the adjacent side is 8 units and the hypotenuse is 10 units, we can substitute these values into the equation to find the opposite side:

\[ 8^2 + \text{Opposite side}^2 = 10^2 \]
\[ 64 + \text{Opposite side}^2 = 100 \]

Subtracting 64 from each side:
\[ \text{Opposite side}^2 = 36 \]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ \text{Opposite side} = 6 \]

So, the opposite side is 6 units.

Step 3: Use the sine formula to find \(\sin{X}\).
\[ \sin{X} = \frac{\text{Opposite side}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} \]
Substituting in the values we found:
\[ \sin{X} = \frac{6}{10} \]
\[ \sin{X} = 0.6 \]

The problem is asking for the volume of a pyramid. The volume \(V\) of a pyramid with base area \(A\) and height \(h\) is given by:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} A \times h \]

1. First, let's find the base area \(A\) of the pyramid:
   - The base of the pyramid is a face of the cube, which is a square.
   - The area \(A\) of a square with side length \(s\) is \(s^2\).
   - Given \(s = 2\), \(A = 2^2 = 4\).

2. Next, let's find the height \(h\) of the pyramid:
   - The height \(h\) of the pyramid is the distance from the center of the cube (which is the apex of the pyramid) to any face of the cube.
   - The distance from the center of the cube to any face is half the side length of the cube.
   - Given \(s = 2\), \(h = \frac{s}{2} = 1\).

3. Plugging the values of \(A\) and \(h\) into the formula:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 4 \times 1 = \frac{4}{3} \]

To find the area of the arrow-shaped polygon, we can break it down into smaller shapes whose areas are easy to calculate.

**Step 1**: Observe that the figure can be broken down into three rectangles and a triangle.

**Step 2**: Calculate the area of the three rectangles:
1. The area of rectangle $BCDF$: Length is $CD = 20$ and the width is $BC = 5$. Hence, the area is $20 \times 5 = 100$.
2. The area of rectangle $FEGD$: Length is $FE = 20$ and the width is $FG = 5$. So, the area is $20 \times 5 = 100$.
3. The area of rectangle $CDE$: Length is $CD = 20$ and the width is $DE = 10$. Therefore, the area is $20 \times 10 = 200$.

**Step 3**: Calculate the area of triangle $ABG$: 
We know that $AB = AG$ (given). Since $BC = FG = 5$, $AC = 5 + 20 = 25$ and $AF = 5 + 20 = 25$. Therefore, the two sides of the triangle $AB$ and $AG$ are both of length $25$. 
The height of the triangle is the difference between the lengths $AF$ and $BC$, which is $25 - 5 = 20$. 
So, the area of triangle $ABG$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 25 \times 20 = 250$.

**Step 4**: Sum up the areas of the three rectangles and the triangle: 
$100 + 100 + 200 + 250 = 650$.

Therefore, the area of polygon $ABCDEFG$ is $\boxed{650}$ square units.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.

**Step 1:** Observe the given properties
Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram:
- $AB = CD$ and $AD = BC$
- Opposite sides are parallel, which means $AB \parallel CD$ and $AD \parallel BC$

Also, since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, then $AM = MB = \frac{1}{2} AB$. Similarly, since $N$ is the midpoint of $BC$, then $BN = NC = \frac{1}{2} BC$.

**Step 2:** Use the properties of a parallelogram
Because $AB \parallel CD$, we know that the transversal $AC$ will create corresponding angles at points $A$, $M$, and $C$. Hence, $\angle MAC = \angle MCD$. Using similar reasoning, since $AD \parallel BC$, we have $\angle CAD = \angle CBN$.

**Step 3:** Use the angle properties to infer that triangles are similar
From the above angles, we can infer:
- $\triangle MCD \sim \triangle MAC$ (by AA similarity)
- $\triangle CBN \sim \triangle CAD$ (by AA similarity)

**Step 4:** Use the properties of similar triangles to set up ratios
Using the properties of similar triangles, we can establish the following ratios:
- $\frac{MD}{MA} = \frac{MC}{MD}$
- $\frac{ND}{AD} = \frac{NC}{ND}$

Given that $AM = MB$ and $BN = NC$, and from the above ratios, we have:
- $MD = 2 \times MA$
- $ND = 2 \times AD$

**Step 5:** Use the property of intersecting lines to determine segments
Given that $DM$ and $DN$ intersect $AC$ at $P$ and $Q$ respectively:
- Since $DM$ divides $AC$ in the ratio 2:1 (from the similar triangles), we get $AP = \frac{2}{3} AC$ and $PC = \frac{1}{3} AC$
- Similarly, $DQ$ divides $AC$ in the ratio 1:2, we get $AQ = \frac{1}{3} AC$ and $QC = \frac{2}{3} AC$

**Step 6:** Calculate the required segment
Given that $AC = 15$, using the ratios from above:
- $AP = \frac{2}{3} \times 15 = 10$
- $AQ = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5$

Therefore, $QA = AC - AQ = 15 - 5 = 10$.

So, $QA = 10$.

Given that $AC$ and $BD$ are diameters, they pass through the center of the circle, and hence they are both radii of the circle.

First, let's understand a property of circles: An angle subtended by a semicircle (or diameter) is always a right angle. This means that any angle whose sides subtend a diameter is 90 degrees. Using this property:

1. Angle $AOC$ = 90 degrees (since it's subtended by diameter $BD$)
2. Angle $BOD$ = 90 degrees (since it's subtended by diameter $AC$)

Now, we are given:
Angle $AOD$ = 54 degrees

Considering the whole circle:
Angle $AOC$ + Angle $AOD$ + Angle $BOD$ = 360 degrees
90 + 54 + 90 = 234 degrees

Now, to find Angle $AOB$, we can subtract the sum of the other angles in the circle from 360 degrees:

Angle $AOB$ = 360 - 234 = 126 degrees.

So, the measure of angle $AOB$ is 126 degrees.

To find the area of the pentagon, we can break it down into shapes for which we can easily calculate the area. Specifically, we can divide the pentagon into a rectangle and a trapezoid.

Step 1: Find the area of the rectangle.
The rectangle has a width of 8'' and a height of 12''. 
Area of rectangle = width × height
Area of rectangle = 8'' × 12'' = 96 square inches.

Step 2: Find the area of the trapezoid.
For a trapezoid, the formula to calculate the area is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{(\text{base}_1 + \text{base}_2) \times \text{height}}{2} \]
Where:
- \(\text{base}_1\) is the longer base, which in this case is 8''.
- \(\text{base}_2\) is the shorter base, which in this case is 6''.
- The height of the trapezoid can be calculated by subtracting the height of the rectangle (12'') from the total height of the pentagon (18''), which gives us a height of \(18'' - 12'' = 6''\).

Plugging in the values, we get:
\[ \text{Area of trapezoid} = \frac{(8'' + 6'') \times 6''}{2} \]
\[ \text{Area of trapezoid} = \frac{14'' \times 6''}{2} \]
\[ \text{Area of trapezoid} = 7'' \times 6'' = 42 square inches. \]

Step 3: Add the areas of the two shapes together to find the total area of the pentagon.
Total area = Area of rectangle + Area of trapezoid
Total area = 96 square inches + 42 square inches = 138 square inches.

The area of the pentagon is 138 square inches.

Alright, let's solve this step-by-step.

1. **Determine the area of the semicircle:**

   The area of a circle is given by the formula \(\pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle. In this case, we have a semicircle, so the area will be half of a full circle. Given that \(r = 1\) meter, the area of the semicircle is:
   \[ \text{Area}_{\text{semicircle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (1)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \]
   So, \(\text{Area}_{\text{semicircle}} = \frac{\pi}{2}\) square meters.

2. **Determine the area of one of the shaded regions:**

   The shaded regions are segments of the semicircle. The area of one of these segments can be determined by subtracting the area of the triangle from the area of the sector it belongs to.

   First, let's calculate the area of one of the triangles:
   Since the three shaded regions are congruent, the angles subtended by each of the shaded regions at the center of the semicircle will be equal. Thus, each of these angles will be:
   \[ \text{Angle} = \frac{180^\circ}{3} = 60^\circ \]

   The area of the sector with central angle \(60^\circ\) is:
   \[ \text{Area}_{\text{sector}} = \frac{60^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{6} \times \pi (1)^2 = \frac{\pi}{6} \]

   Now, to find the area of the triangle:
   The triangle is an isosceles triangle with a vertex angle of \(60^\circ\). The base of the triangle is the chord of the sector, and its length can be found using trigonometry. 
   Let \(b\) be the length of the base and \(h\) be the height of the triangle (which is also the radius of the semicircle). Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:
   \[ b = 2h \cos(30^\circ) = 2(1) \times \sqrt{3}/2 = \sqrt{3} \]

   The height of the triangle (which is different from the radius) can be found using:
   \[ h_{triangle} = h \sin(30^\circ) = 1 \times 1/2 = 1/2 \]

   Now, the area of the triangle is:
   \[ \text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h_{triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \]

   So, the area of one shaded region is:
   \[ \text{Area}_{\text{shaded}} = \text{Area}_{\text{sector}} - \text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} \]
   \[ \text{Area}_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \]

3. **Calculate the area of the trapezoid:**

   The area of the trapezoid is equal to the area of the semicircle minus three times the area of the shaded regions:
   \[ \text{Area}_{\text{trapezoid}} = \text{Area}_{\text{semicircle}} - 3 \times \text{Area}_{\text{shaded}} \]
   \[ \text{Area}_{\text{trapezoid}} = \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \left( \frac{\pi}{6} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right) \]
   \[ \text{Area}_{\text{trapezoid}} = \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
   \[ \text{Area}_{\text{trapezoid}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} \]

Approximating:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{trapezoid}} \approx 1.3 \]
So, the area of the trapezoid is approximately \(1.3\) square meters.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Understand the Problem.

We have to find the smallest angle in triangle \(PQS\). To do that, we'll need to find out more about the triangle, especially the lengths of its sides.

**Step 2:** Establish known distances.

We know that each circle has a radius of 1. So:
\(PQ = 2\) (because the two circles with centers P and Q touch each other),
\(PS = 2\) (because the two circles with centers P and S touch each other),
\(RS = 2\) (because the two circles with centers R and S touch each other).

**Step 3:** Calculate \(QS\).

Now, let's look at the triangles \(QBR\) and \(SCR\).

In \(\triangle QBR\):
Height = \(RQ + 1 = 3\)
Base = \(2\)
Thus, Area = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 3 = 3\)

The area of \(\triangle QBR\) can also be calculated using Heron's formula. Let's denote the length \(QB\) as \(a\) and \(BR\) as \(b\).

Using Heron's formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-2)} \]
Where \( s \) is the semi-perimeter \( = \frac{a+b+2}{2} \).

From \(\triangle SCR\):
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times (3+RS) = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 5 = 5 \]

Again, using Heron's formula, the area can also be given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-2)} \]
Where \( s \) is the semi-perimeter \( = \frac{a+b+2}{2} \).

From these two triangles, we can equate the two expressions for the areas to find \(a\) and \(b\). Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find \(QS = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).

**Step 4:** Apply the Law of Cosines.

Now, we'll use the Law of Cosines to find the smallest angle, which will be opposite the shortest side, \(PS\):
\[ PS^2 = PQ^2 + QS^2 - 2(PQ)(QS)\cos(\angle PQS) \]

From this equation, we can solve for \(\cos(\angle PQS)\) and then find \(\angle PQS\).

**Step 5:** Solve for \(\angle PQS\).

By substituting in the known values:
\[ 4 = 4 + QS^2 - 2(QS)\cos(\angle PQS) \]
\[ QS^2 - 2(QS)\cos(\angle PQS) = 0 \]
\[ \cos(\angle PQS) = \frac{QS^2}{2 \times QS} \]
\[ \cos(\angle PQS) = \frac{QS}{2} \]

Using the inverse cosine function, we can determine \(\angle PQS\).

From the given information and without the exact value of \(QS\), we cannot provide a numerical value for the smallest angle in triangle \(PQS\). However, the steps above detail how to find it once \(QS\) is determined.

Let $AP = DP = \frac{AD}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem for $\triangle APO$:
\[AO^2 = AP^2 + OP^2\]
\[10^2 = 6^2 + OP^2\]
\[100 = 36 + OP^2\]
\[OP^2 = 64\]
\[OP = 8\]

So, the altitude of the isosceles triangle is 8 units.

2. **Find the area of each isosceles triangle:** 
Now, we'll use the base and height (altitude) to determine the area of each isosceles triangle.

For triangle $DAO$ (and similarly for the other two triangles):
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 8 = 48 \text{ square units}\]

3. **Calculate the total area of trapezoid $ABCD$:** 
Since trapezoid $ABCD$ is made up of three of these triangles, the total area is:
\[ \text{Area} = 3 \times 48 = 144 \text{ square units}\]

So, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is \( \boxed{144 \text{ square units}} \).

Since \(\angle AXB\) and \(\angle ABP\) are supplementary angles (because they are on a straight line), we have:

The altitude from \(E\) to \(AB\) divides triangle \(ABE\) into two right triangles. Let's call the point where the altitude meets \(AB\) as point \(F\).

Using similar triangles, we can find that:

\(\frac{AF}{3} = \frac{FE}{4}\)

Given \(AB = 4\), \(AF = \frac{4}{2} = 2\) (because \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AD\)).

Therefore, \(FE = \frac{2 \times 4}{3} = \frac{8}{3}\).

**Step 4:** Find the area of triangle \(ABE\).

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times \frac{8}{3} \]

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{32}{6} = \frac{16}{3} \]

So, the area of \(\triangle ABE\) is \(\frac{16}{3}\) square units.

Alright, let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Recognize the properties of a circle with respect to angles and arcs.**
   - An inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   - The arc measure of a semicircle is \(180^\circ\).

2. **Find the measure of arc \(GP\).**
   - Given that \(\angle GOP = 78^\circ\), the measure of arc \(GP\) is twice that, since an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   - So, arc \(GP = 2 \times 78^\circ = 156^\circ\).

3. **Determine the measure of arc \(GN\).**
   - Since \(GP\) and \(GN\) together make up the arc of a semicircle (because \(PG\) is a diameter), the measure of arc \(GN\) is:
   - \(180^\circ - 156^\circ = 24^\circ\).

4. **Find the measure of \(\angle NGA\).**
   - Now, using the property of inscribed angles, \(\angle NGA\) is half the measure of its intercepted arc \(GN\).
   - So, \(\angle NGA = \frac{24^\circ}{2} = 12^\circ\).

Therefore, the measure of \(\angle NGA\) is \(12^\circ\).

To determine the length of the lateral height, \( \overline{AB} \), of the pyramid, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. But before that, we need to find the length of the side of the square base, which we can call \( s \).

To start, let's determine the volume of the square pyramid. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a square pyramid is:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times (\text{base area}) \times \text{height} \]

Given that \( V = 63,960 \) cubic meters and the height \( h = 30 \) meters, we can use the formula to determine the base area:

\[ 63,960 = \frac{1}{3} \times s^2 \times 30 \]

Solving for \( s^2 \) (the area of the base):

\[ s^2 = \frac{63,960 \times 3}{30} \]
\[ s^2 = 6396 \]

Taking the square root of both sides to find \( s \):

\[ s = 80 \]

So, the side length of the square base is 80 meters.

Now, let's find \( \overline{AB} \) using the Pythagorean theorem. We know:
\[ AB^2 = s^2 + h^2 \]

Plugging in the values we have:

\[ AB^2 = 80^2 + 30^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 6400 + 900 \]
\[ AB^2 = 7300 \]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[ AB \approx 85.4 \]

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the lateral height \( \overline{AB} \) of the pyramid is approximately \( 85 \) meters.

Given the information in the problem:

1. \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle PAQ\)
2. \(\triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP\)
3. \(m\angle BAC = 70^\circ\)

To find \(m\angle PQC\), we can use the property of similar triangles, which says that the corresponding angles of similar triangles are congruent.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. From \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle PAQ\):

\(\angle BAC\) corresponds to \(\angle PAQ\).

Therefore, \(m\angle PAQ = 70^\circ\).

2. From \(\triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP\):

\(\angle BAQ\) corresponds to \(\angle QCP\).

Given that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\), in \(\triangle ABQ\):

\[m\angle BAQ + m\angle BQA + m\angle ABQ = 180^\circ\]
\[m\angle BAQ + 70^\circ + m\angle ABQ = 180^\circ\]
\[m\angle BAQ + m\angle ABQ = 110^\circ\]

Since \(\angle ABQ\) and \(\angle QCP\) are vertical angles, they are congruent:

\[m\angle ABQ = m\angle QCP\]

Substituting the value of \(\angle QCP\) from the above equation, we get:

\[m\angle BAQ + m\angle QCP = 110^\circ\]

3. Now, to find \(m\angle PQC\):

We know:

\(\angle PAQ + \angle PQC + \angle QCP = 180^\circ\) (because they are the angles of triangle \(PQC\))

Using the information we found:

\[70^\circ + m\angle PQC + m\angle QCP = 180^\circ\]
\[70^\circ + m\angle PQC + (110^\circ - m\angle BAQ) = 180^\circ\]
\[m\angle PQC - m\angle BAQ = 0^\circ\]
\[m\angle PQC = m\angle BAQ\]

So, \(m\angle PQC\) is congruent to \(m\angle BAQ\).

Given the information above:

\[m\angle BAQ + m\angle BQA + m\angle ABQ = 180^\circ\]
\[m\angle BAQ + 70^\circ + m\angle PQC = 180^\circ\]
\[m\angle BAQ + m\angle PQC = 110^\circ\]

Dividing the above equation by 2:

\[m\angle PQC = 55^\circ\]

Thus, \(m\angle PQC = 55^\circ\).

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Understand the given information.
You're given that the pyramid $ABCH$ has a volume of 20. 

Step 2: Relate the volume of the pyramid to the volume of the rectangular prism.
Recall that the volume \( V \) of a pyramid with base area \( B \) and height \( h \) is given by:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} B h \]

In this case, the base of the pyramid $ABCH$ is the rectangle $ABCD$ and its height is the distance from point $E$ (the apex of the pyramid) perpendicular to the base, which would be the height of the rectangular prism.

The volume of the rectangular prism \( V_{prism} \) is given by:
\[ V_{prism} = B h \]
where \( B \) is the area of the base $ABCD$ and \( h \) is its height.

Step 3: Express the volume of the pyramid in terms of the volume of the rectangular prism.
Using the volume formulas from Step 2, the volume of the pyramid can be expressed as:
\[ V_{pyramid} = \frac{1}{3} V_{prism} \]

Given that \( V_{pyramid} \) is 20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 20 = \frac{1}{3} V_{prism} \]

Step 4: Solve for the volume of the rectangular prism.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 3, we get:
\[ V_{prism} = 60 \]

Therefore, the volume of the right rectangular prism $ABCDEFGH$ is \( 60 \) cubic units.

The diagram helps us visualize the problem, but we should also sketch a rough diagram to keep track of our calculations.

We will approach this problem in stages, calculating areas of recognizable figures and using the Pythagorean Theorem to find lengths as needed.

**Step 1:** 
Calculate the area of $\triangle ABC$.

Using Heron's formula:
\[ s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} = \frac{13 + 5 + 12}{2} = 15 \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ABC} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ABC} = \sqrt{15(15-13)(15-5)(15-12)} = \sqrt{15(2)(10)(3)} = \sqrt{900} = 30 \]

**Step 2:** 
Find the lengths of segments $MJ$ and $NK$.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem for $\triangle AMJ$:
\[ AJ^2 = AM^2 + MJ^2 \]
\[ AJ^2 = 4^2 + MJ^2 \]
\[ AJ = \sqrt{AB^2 - BJ^2} = \sqrt{13^2 - BJ^2} \]
Solving for $BJ$ gives:
\[ BJ^2 = 13^2 - (4^2 + MJ^2) \]
\[ BJ^2 = 169 - 16 - MJ^2 \]
\[ BJ^2 = 153 - MJ^2 \]
Now, since $BJ + JK = BK = 12$, we have:
\[ BJ = 12 - JK \]
And using the Pythagorean Theorem for $\triangle CNK$:
\[ CK^2 = CN^2 + NK^2 \]
\[ CK^2 = 4^2 + NK^2 \]
\[ CK = \sqrt{CB^2 - BK^2} = \sqrt{12^2 - (12-JK)^2} \]
Solving for $JK$ gives:
\[ JK^2 = 12^2 - (4^2 + NK^2) \]
\[ JK^2 = 144 - 16 - NK^2 \]
\[ JK^2 = 128 - NK^2 \]
Using the relation $BJ + JK = 12$, we get:
\[ 153 - MJ^2 + 128 - NK^2 = 12^2 \]
\[ 281 - MJ^2 - NK^2 = 144 \]
\[ MJ^2 + NK^2 = 137 \]

**Step 3:**
Calculate the areas of $\triangle AMJ$, $\triangle CNK$, and $\triangle CMN$.

\[ \text{Area}_{AMJ} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AM \cdot MJ = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 \cdot \sqrt{137 - NK^2} \]

\[ \text{Area}_{CNK} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot CN \cdot NK = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 \cdot \sqrt{137 - MJ^2} \]

Since $CM = CN$, $\triangle CMN$ is isosceles and its height (altitude) is also 4. So, 
\[ \text{Area}_{CMN} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot MN \cdot 4 \]
\[ MN^2 = MC^2 - CN^2 \]
\[ MN^2 = 5^2 - 4^2 = 9 \]
\[ MN = 3 \]
\[ \text{Area}_{CMN} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 6 \]

**Step 4:**
Calculate the area of pentagon $CMJKN$.

\[ \text{Area}_{CMJKN} = \text{Area}_{ABC} - (\text{Area}_{AMJ} + \text{Area}_{CNK} + \text{Area}_{CMN}) \]
\[ \text{Area}_{CMJKN} = 30 - (2 \cdot \sqrt{137} + 6) \]

The area of pentagon $CMJKN$ is $30 - 2 \cdot \sqrt{137}$.

Given that triangles \(ABC\) and \(ABD\) are isosceles with \(AB = AC = BD\), and \(BD\) is perpendicular to \(AC\), we can determine the angles of the triangles.

Step 1: Determine the angles in triangle \(ABC\)

Since \(ABC\) is an isosceles triangle with \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle BAC\). 
Let's call this angle \(x\).
Given that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\), we have:
\(\angle ABC + \angle BAC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ\)
\(x + x + \angle BCA = 180^\circ\)
\(2x + \angle BCA = 180^\circ\)

\(\angle BCA\) is the base angle of the isosceles triangle, so:
\(\angle BCA = 180^\circ - 2x\)

Step 2: Determine the angles in triangle \(ABD\)

Since \(ABD\) is also an isosceles triangle with \(AB = BD\), \(\angle BAD = \angle ABD\). Let's call this angle \(y\).
Given that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\), we have:
\(\angle BAD + \angle ABD + \angle BDA = 180^\circ\)
\(y + y + \angle BDA = 180^\circ\)
\(2y + \angle BDA = 180^\circ\)

\(\angle BDA\) is the base angle of the isosceles triangle, so:
\(\angle BDA = 180^\circ - 2y\)

Step 3: Use the fact that \(BD\) is perpendicular to \(AC\) 

\(\angle BDE = 90^\circ\)
Since \(BD\) is a straight line, \(\angle ADE = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ\)

Step 4: Use the fact that the sum of angles on a straight line is \(180^\circ\)

\(\angle C + \angle ADE = 180^\circ\)
\(\angle C + 90^\circ = 180^\circ\)
\(\angle C = 90^\circ\)

From Step 1, we found that:
\(\angle BCA = 180^\circ - 2x\)
But since \(\angle BCA = \angle C = 90^\circ\):
\(180^\circ - 2x = 90^\circ\)
\- 2x = -90^\circ\
x = 45^\circ

Thus, \(\angle BAD = \angle ABD = 45^\circ\)

Step 5: Determine \(\angle D\)

\(\angle ADE = 90^\circ\)
\(\angle BAD + \angle ADE = \angle BDA\)
\(45^\circ + 90^\circ = \angle D\)
\(\angle D = 135^\circ\)

Step 6: Summing up \(\angle C\) and \(\angle D\)

\(\angle C + \angle D = 90^\circ + 135^\circ = 225^\circ\)

Therefore, \(\angle C + \angle D = 225^\circ\).

Sure, let's solve the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Setting Up
First, let's denote the side length of equilateral triangle $ABC$ as $s$.

### Step 2: Finding Heights
Given that $\overline{ED}\perp\overline{BC}$, $ED$ is the height of $\triangle DEF$. Since $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, its height (from $A$ to $BC$) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, and is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$. 

Now, let's consider $\triangle EBC$. Since $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, $BC = s$. Now, $BE = \frac{2}{3}s$ because $BE$ is two times the length of $EC$. $EC$ is one-third of $BC$ because $\triangle DEF$ is inscribed in $\triangle ABC$ such that it divides $BC$ into three congruent segments. Using the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle EBC$:

\[EC^2 + ED^2 = (\frac{2}{3}s)^2\]

Given that $EC = \frac{1}{3}s$, we get:
\[\left(\frac{1}{3}s\right)^2 + ED^2 = \frac{4}{9}s^2\]

\[ED^2 = \frac{4}{9}s^2 - \frac{1}{9}s^2 = \frac{3}{9}s^2 = \frac{1}{3}s^2\]

\[ED = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}s\]

### Step 3: Finding Areas
Area of $\triangle ABC$:
\[A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2\]

Area of $\triangle DEF$:
\[A_{DEF} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}s = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}s^2\]

### Step 4: Finding the Ratio
\[\text{Ratio} = \frac{A_{DEF}}{A_{ABC}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}s^2}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2} = \frac{2}{3}\]

Thus, the ratio of the area of $\triangle DEF$ to the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.

Given that the diagonal of the square is 12 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the side length of the square.

Let's say the side length of the square is \( s \). Then, by using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle \( WYX \) (or any other triangle with the diagonal as the hypotenuse), we have:

\[ s^2 + s^2 = 12^2 \]
\[ 2s^2 = 144 \]
\[ s^2 = 72 \]
\[ s = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2} \]

So, each side of the square has a length of \( 6\sqrt{2} \) units.

Now, given that point \( A \) is the midpoint of segment \( WX \), \( WA \) and \( AX \) are each half the side length:

\[ WA = AX = \frac{6\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3\sqrt{2} \] 

Now, observe triangle \( ABC \). \( AC \) is a height dropped from the right angle of a right triangle to its hypotenuse. In such a case, if we let \( h \) be the height, \( b \) be the length of one leg, and \( c \) be the hypotenuse:

\[ h^2 = b(b+c) \]

In this case, \( h = AC = AB = 3\sqrt{2} \) and \( b = AX = 3\sqrt{2} \). Let \( c = BC \).

Thus,

\[ (3\sqrt{2})^2 = 3\sqrt{2}(3\sqrt{2} + c) \]
\[ 18 = 18 + 3\sqrt{2}c \]
\[ 3\sqrt{2}c = 0 \]
\[ c = 0 \]

But this is clearly not possible since the diagram shows that segment \( BC \) has a positive length.

Let's try another approach.

We know:

\[ AB = AC \]
\[ AB = BC - AX \]
\[ AB = BC - 3\sqrt{2} \]

And

\[ AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 \]

Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle \( ABC \):

\[ (BC - 3\sqrt{2})^2 + BC^2 = (3\sqrt{2})^2 \]
\[ BC^2 - 6\sqrt{2}BC + 18 + BC^2 = 18 \]
\[ 2BC^2 - 6\sqrt{2}BC = 0 \]
\[ BC(2BC - 6\sqrt{2}) = 0 \]

From this, \( BC = 0 \) or \( 2BC - 6\sqrt{2} = 0 \).

The latter gives \( BC = 3\sqrt{2} \).

Thus, the length of segment \( BC \) is \( 3\sqrt{2} \) units.

Sure, let's tackle this step by step.

**Step 1:** Let's first calculate the area of one of the triangles in the octagon. To do this, let's take triangle $ABH$ as an example.

**Step 2:** The triangle $ABH$ is an isosceles right triangle. This means that if we draw a perpendicular from $B$ to $AH$ (let's call the point of intersection $M$), it will bisect $AH$ and $BM$ will be equal to $AM$.

**Step 3:** Since $ABCDEFGH$ is a regular octagon, all of its sides are of equal length. Let's say each side has a length of $s$. This means that $AM$ and $BM$ both have lengths of $s/2$. Therefore, $AB$ is of length $s$.

**Step 4:** The area of triangle $ABM$ is given by:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABM = \frac{1}{2} \times AM \times BM = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{s}{2} \times \frac{s}{2} = \frac{s^2}{8} \]

**Step 5:** Since triangle $ABH$ consists of two such triangles ($\triangle ABM$ and $\triangle HBM$), its area is:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABH = 2 \times \frac{s^2}{8} = \frac{s^2}{4} \]

**Step 6:** The entire octagon consists of eight such triangles. Therefore, the area of the octagon is:
\[ \text{Area of octagon} = 8 \times \frac{s^2}{4} = 2s^2 \]

But we are given that the area of the octagon is 1 square unit. So:
\[ 2s^2 = 1 \]
\[ s^2 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \]

**Step 7:** Now, let's calculate the area of the rectangle $ABEF$. The length of the rectangle is the same as the length of one side of the octagon, which is $s$. The width of the rectangle is twice the length of $AM$ (because it's $AM + ME$). Therefore, the width is $s$. 

\[ \text{Area of rectangle } ABEF = s \times s = s^2 = \frac{1}{2} \]

So, the area of rectangle $ABEF$ is **0.5 square units**.

Alright, let's solve the problem step by step.

First, note that we can think of a truncated cone (also known as a frustum) as the difference between two full cones: a larger cone and the portion of the cone that was removed to create the truncation.

Step 1: Find the Volume of the Large Cone

We'll first find the volume of the entire cone that has the base of 8 cm radius and includes the truncated portion. 

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a right circular cone is:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

Where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base
- \( h \) is the height

However, we don't have the height of the large cone directly. We'll have to use the Pythagorean theorem to find it. Consider the cross-section of the cone. The small radius, large radius, and slant height of the truncated cone form a right triangle.

Using the given dimensions:
- Small radius ( \( r_1 \) ) = 4 cm
- Large radius ( \( r_2 \) ) = 8 cm
- Difference in radii = \( r_2 - r_1 \) = 8 cm - 4 cm = 4 cm

Using the Pythagorean theorem on this triangle:
\[ \text{slant height}^2 = \text{height}^2 + \text{difference in radii}^2 \]

Given the height of the truncated cone is 6 cm,
\[ \text{slant height}^2 = 6^2 + 4^2 \]
\[ \text{slant height}^2 = 36 + 16 \]
\[ \text{slant height}^2 = 52 \]
\[ \text{slant height} = \sqrt{52} = 2\sqrt{13} \]

This slant height ( \( 2\sqrt{13} \) ) will be the hypotenuse of another right triangle formed by the height of the large cone (which we'll call \( H \) ), the large radius (8 cm), and the slant height.

Using the Pythagorean theorem again:
\[ H^2 + 8^2 = (2\sqrt{13})^2 \]
\[ H^2 + 64 = 52 \]
\[ H^2 = -12 \]

This is not possible (we can't have a negative height squared). This indicates that we made an error in our reasoning. We should have used the small radius as one of the legs in the triangle with the slant height.

Let's fix that:
\[ H - 4 \] is the height of the smaller cone that's removed.
\[ (H - 4)^2 + 4^2 = (2\sqrt{13})^2 \]
\[ H^2 - 8H + 16 + 16 = 52 \]
\[ H^2 - 8H - 20 = 0 \]

By factoring or using the quadratic formula, we get the height \( H \) of the larger cone.

However, another simpler way to approach it is by realizing that the radii and height of the frustum are proportional. So,
\[ \frac{H}{8} = \frac{H - 6}{4} \]
\[ 4H = 8H - 48 \]
\[ 4H = 48 \]
\[ H = 12 \]

Thus, the height of the larger cone is 12 cm.

Now, let's find its volume:
\[ V_{\text{large cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (8^2) (12) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (64) (12) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (768) = 256\pi \]

Step 2: Find the Volume of the Small Cone

Now, let's find the volume of the small cone that was removed to create the frustum. Its radius is 4 cm, and its height is (12 - 6 = 6 cm):

\[ V_{\text{small cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (4^2) (6) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (16) (6) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (96) = 32\pi \]

Step 3: Find the Volume of the Frustum

The volume of the frustum is the difference between the volumes of the large cone and the small cone:

\[ V_{\text{frustum}} = V_{\text{large cone}} - V_{\text{small cone}} \]
\[ V_{\text{frustum}} = 256\pi - 32\pi = 224\pi \]

Thus, \( n = 224 \).

### Step 1: Find the radius of the inscribed sphere.

We have a cone with height \( h = 4 \) units and base radius \( R = 3 \) units. The sphere is inscribed inside the cone, so the radius of the sphere \( r \) will be equal to the radius of the base of the smaller cone, which has the same vertex as the larger cone and the base at the center of the sphere.

Using similar triangles, we can find \( r \):

\[ \frac{r}{R} = \frac{h - r}{h} \]
Where:
\( r \) = radius of the sphere (and also the radius of the base of the smaller cone)
\( R \) = base radius of the larger cone = 3 units
\( h \) = height of the larger cone = 4 units

Solving for \( r \):
\[ r \cdot h = r \cdot R + R \cdot h \]
\[ 4r = 3r + 12 \]
\[ r = 12 \]

So, the radius of the inscribed sphere is \( r = 12 \) units.

### Step 2: Calculate the volume of the sphere.

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere with radius \( r \) is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

Plugging in our value for \( r \):
\[ V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (12^3) \]
\[ V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (1728) \]
\[ V_{sphere} = 2304\pi \] cubic units

### Step 3: Calculate the volume of the cone.

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cone with base radius \( R \) and height \( h \) is:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi R^2 h \]

Plugging in our values for \( R \) and \( h \):
\[ V_{cone} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3^2) (4) \]
\[ V_{cone} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (9) (4) \]
\[ V_{cone} = 36\pi \] cubic units

### Step 4: Find the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cone.

\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{V_{sphere}}{V_{cone}} \]
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{2304\pi}{36\pi} \]
\[ \text{Ratio} = 64 \]

So, the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cone is \( 64:1 \).

Sure! Let's solve this step-by-step.

Step 1: Understand the pentagon
The interior angle of a regular pentagon is given by:
\[ \text{Interior angle of pentagon} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n} \]
Where \( n \) is the number of sides (which is 5 for a pentagon). Plugging in the value, we get:
\[ \text{Interior angle of pentagon} = \frac{3 \times 180^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ \]

Step 2: Calculate the angles of the sectors formed by the circle
The circle is tangent to lines \( DC \) and \( AB \) at \( D \) and \( A \) respectively. Tangents drawn to a circle from the same external point are equal in length. This means \( AD \) and \( AE \) are equal in length, and similarly, \( AD \) and \( BD \) are equal in length.

From this, we can infer that:

\[ \angle AED = \angle ABD = 108^\circ \]

Since \( AED \) and \( ABD \) are isosceles triangles with \( AD \) as the base for both. 

Step 3: Calculate the angle subtended by arc \( AD \) at the center of the circle
The measure of the arc can be found by subtracting the two angles \( \angle AED \) and \( \angle ABD \) from \( 360^\circ \) (total angle at the center of a circle):
\[ \text{Angle subtended by arc } AD = 360^\circ - 108^\circ - 108^\circ = 144^\circ \]

Thus, minor arc \( AD \) subtends an angle of \( 144^\circ \) at the center of the circle.

Answer: The measure of minor arc \( AD \) is \( 144^\circ \).

The cube has an edge length of \(30 \text{ cm}\). 
Volume of a cube is given by: 
\[ V_{cube} = s^3 \]

Given that the diameter of the sphere is equal to the height of the box (or the edge length of the cube), the radius \( r \) of the sphere is \( r = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ cm} \).
The volume of a sphere is given by:

\[ V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3,375) \]
\[ V_{sphere} = 4,500\pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

3. **Find the Volume Not Occupied by the Sphere**:
To find the volume of the box that is not occupied by the sphere, we subtract the volume of the sphere from the volume of the cube:
\[ V_{empty} = V_{cube} - V_{sphere} \]
\[ V_{empty} = 27,000 \text{ cm}^3 - 4,500\pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

Given that the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, the arcs intercepted by its sides can be used to determine the interior angles of the hexagon.

For any inscribed angle in a circle, the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Let's take the angle of \( \alpha \) as an example:

The arc intercepted by angle \( \alpha \) is the sum of the arcs opposite to the two 120° angles, because \( \alpha \) subtends those arcs. Therefore, the measure of the intercepted arc is \( 2 \times 120^\circ = 240^\circ \).

Using the formula for inscribed angles:
\[ \text{angle} = \frac{\text{intercepted arc}}{2} \]
\[ \alpha = \frac{240^\circ}{2} = 120^\circ \]

Alright, let's tackle the problem step by step.

Step 1: Setting up the coordinate system

Considering the image, let's place the entire setup on a coordinate plane. The center of the first circle will be at $(s,s)$ since it's tangent to both axes. The center of the second circle will be at $(3s,s)$, and the third circle's center will be at $(s,3s)$.

Step 2: Finding the equation of the larger circle

Let's find the equation of the circle with radius $r$ centered at $(a,a)$.

The distance from its center to the origin is $a$ (which is also the distance from the center to both the x-axis and y-axis). This means that the distance from the circle's edge to the origin is $a - r$.

Now, the third circle touches both the y-axis and the larger circle. Therefore, the y-coordinate of the point where these two circles touch is $a - r + s$ (subtracting r from a to move downwards to the edge of the larger circle and adding s to reach the touching point).

For the larger circle, we can use the equation:
\[ (x - a)^2 + (y - a)^2 = r^2 \]

When y = $a - r + s$, we get:
\[ (x - a)^2 + (-r + s)^2 = r^2 \]
(1)

Step 3: Using the tangent property

The second circle touches the x-axis and is also tangent to the larger circle. The x-coordinate of the point where these two circles touch is $a - r + s$ (similar reasoning as before).

Plugging this x value in our circle equation, we get:
\[ (-r + s)^2 + (y - a)^2 = r^2 \]
(2)

Step 4: Equating the two equations

From the symmetry of the situation, the point where the third circle touches the larger circle and the point where the second circle touches the larger circle should lie on the line y=x. Therefore, plugging y=x into equation (1), we get:
\[ (x - a)^2 + (x - a)^2 = r^2 \]
\[ 2(x - a)^2 = r^2 \]
(3)

Now, plugging y=x into equation (2), we get:
\[ (-r + s)^2 + (x - a)^2 = r^2 \]
(4)

Equating (3) and (4), we have:
\[ 2(x - a)^2 = (-r + s)^2 + (x - a)^2 \]

Step 5: Simplifying the equations

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[ x - a = \sqrt{2}(-r + s) \]
But we know $x = a - r + s$, so:
\[ a - r + s - a = \sqrt{2}(-r + s) \]
\[ -r + s = -\sqrt{2}r + \sqrt{2}s \]
\[ r(1 + \sqrt{2}) = s(1 - \sqrt{2}) \]

Therefore, 
\[ \frac{r}{s} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{2}}{1 + \sqrt{2}} \]

Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we get:
\[ \frac{r}{s} = \frac{(1 - \sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2})}{(1 + \sqrt{2})(1 - \sqrt{2})} \]
\[ \frac{r}{s} = \frac{1 - 2\sqrt{2} + 2}{1 - 2} \]
\[ \frac{r}{s} = 3 - 2\sqrt{2} \]

So, the final answer is \( r/s = 3 - 2\sqrt{2} \).

2. **Finding the Side Length of the Inner Square**: 
   The inner square is formed by joining the midpoints of the outer square's sides. This means that each side of the inner square is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where the other two sides are half the length of the outer square (which is 2 inches each).
   Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   $$\text{Hypotenuse}^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 8$$
   Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
   $$\text{Hypotenuse} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \text{ inches.}$$

   So, the side length of the inner square is \(2\sqrt{2}\) inches.

3. **Finding the Area of the Inner Square**:

4. **Finding the Area of One Shaded Triangle**: 
   The base of one of the shaded triangles is half the side of the outer square, which is 2 inches. The height of this triangle is also half the side of the outer square, which is 2 inches. 
   $$\text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2 \text{ square inches.}$$

5. **Finding the Total Area of the Shaded Region**: 
   There are 4 such triangles. Therefore:
   $$\text{Total area of the shaded region} = 4 \times \text{Area of one triangle} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ square inches.}$$

6. **Finding the Area of the Unshaded Region**:

Alright! Let's solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Determine the dimensions of the cylinder and cone:**

From the problem, we know:
- Diameter of the base of the silo (and thus, both the cylinder and the cone) is 10 meters, which means the radius \( r \) is 5 meters.
- Height of the entire silo is 27 meters.

Given that the height of the cone is half the height of the cylinder, let's denote the height of the cylinder as \( 2h \) and the height of the cone as \( h \). Therefore:
\[ 2h + h = 27 \]
\[ 3h = 27 \]
\[ h = 9 \]

So, the height of the cylinder \( 2h \) is 18 meters and the height of the cone \( h \) is 9 meters.

**2. Calculate the volume of the cylinder:**

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{cylinder} = \pi r^2 h_{cylinder} \]
Plugging in the values we have:
\[ V_{cylinder} = \pi (5^2)(18) \]
\[ V_{cylinder} = \pi (25)(18) \]
\[ V_{cylinder} = 450\pi \]

**3. Calculate the volume of the cone:**

The formula for the volume of a cone is:
\[ V_{cone} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h_{cone} \]
Plugging in the values we have:
\[ V_{cone} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (5^2)(9) \]
\[ V_{cone} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (25)(9) \]
\[ V_{cone} = 75\pi \]

**4. Calculate the total volume of the silo:**

The total volume \( V_{silo} \) is the sum of the volume of the cylinder and the cone:
\[ V_{silo} = V_{cylinder} + V_{cone} \]
\[ V_{silo} = 450\pi + 75\pi \]
\[ V_{silo} = 525\pi \]

Therefore, the volume of the silo is \( 525\pi \) cubic meters.

Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1:** Understand the Original Square
Given an 8-inch by 8-inch square, the area is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) square inches.

**Step 2:** Fold the Square Along the Diagonal
When the square is folded in half along its diagonal, it forms two congruent right triangles. The hypotenuse of each triangle is the diagonal of the square. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the diagonal (hypotenuse) can be found:

\[ d^2 = 8^2 + 8^2 \]
\[ d^2 = 64 + 64 \]
\[ d^2 = 128 \]
\[ d = \sqrt{128} = 8\sqrt{2} \]

**Step 3:** Fold the Triangle to Form the Trapezoid
When the triangle is folded such that the right angle vertex meets the midpoint of the hypotenuse, a smaller triangle is formed inside the original triangle. This smaller triangle has a base half the length of the hypotenuse, which is \( \frac{8\sqrt{2}}{2} = 4\sqrt{2} \) inches.

To find the height of this smaller triangle, note that it's a 45-45-90 triangle (since the original triangle was a right triangle and the triangle is bisected along its height). This means the height is also \( 4\sqrt{2} \) inches.

The area of the smaller triangle is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 4\sqrt{2} \times 4\sqrt{2} = 32 \] square inches.

**Step 4:** Find the Area of the Trapezoid
Since the original triangle has an area of \( \frac{1}{2} \times 64 = 32 \) square inches (half the area of the square), and the smaller triangle also has an area of 32 square inches, the area of the trapezoidal region (which is the original triangle minus the smaller triangle) is:

\[ 32 - 32 = 0 \] square inches.

However, this can't be right since the trapezoid occupies some space. Let's re-examine our folding.

Upon re-examination, we can see that the triangle isn't actually folded in half; rather, the right-angle vertex is folded to the midpoint of the hypotenuse. This means the smaller triangle isn't half the area of the original triangle; instead, it's a quarter of the area.

Thus, the area of the smaller triangle is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \) square inches.

Now, the area of the trapezoidal region is:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \] square inches.

So, the area of the resulting trapezoidal figure is \( \boxed{16} \) square inches.

2. In any circle, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle that subtends the same arc. Therefore, $\angle JHN = \frac{1}{2} \angle JON = 45^\circ$.

Now, consider triangle $HJN$:

3. The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$. Given that $\angle JHN = 45^\circ$ and $\angle JNH = 90^\circ$, we can find $\angle J$ as:

\[ \angle H = 180^\circ - 45^\circ - 90^\circ = 45^\circ \]

Adding the two angles together, we get:

\[ m\angle J + m\angle H = 45^\circ + 45^\circ = 90^\circ \]

Thus, the sum of the measures of $\angle J$ and $\angle H$ is \( \boxed{90^\circ} \).

**Step 2: Calculate the area of the smaller diamond shape.**

The smaller diamond shape is essentially a square that has been rotated \(45^\circ\). The length of one side of this diamond is \(c\), so its area is:

\[ \text{Area of the diamond} = c^2 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the area of the four shaded triangles.**

Each of the shaded triangles is right-angled and has one leg of length \(a\) and another leg of length \(b\). The area of one of these triangles is:

\[ \text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \]

Since there are four such triangles, their combined area is:

\[ \text{Total area of the four triangles} = 4 \times \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = 2ab \]

**Step 4: Determine the area of the shaded region.**

The shaded region consists of the four triangles surrounding the diamond. To find the total shaded area, subtract the area of the diamond from the total area of the square, and then add the area of the four triangles:

\[ \text{Shaded area} = \text{Area of the square} - \text{Area of the diamond} + \text{Total area of the four triangles} \]

\[ \text{Shaded area} = (a + b)^2 - c^2 + 2ab \]

Using the given information that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are consecutive integers, we can represent \(b\) as \(a + 1\) and \(c\) as \(a + 2\). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ \text{Shaded area} = (a + a + 1)^2 - (a + 2)^2 + 2a(a + 1) \]

\[ \text{Shaded area} = (2a + 1)^2 - (a + 2)^2 + 2a(a + 1) \]

\[ \text{Shaded area} = 4a^2 + 4a + 1 - a^2 - 4a - 4 + 2a^2 + 2a \]

\[ \text{Shaded area} = 5a^2 + 2a - 3 \]

If we take any two adjacent points on the grid, the distance between them is $1$. If these two points were to be the endpoints of a side of a square, then the side length of the square would be $1$, and its area would be $A = 1^2 = 1$.

**Step 2: Consider a square side that skips one point**

If instead of two adjacent points, we take two points that have exactly one point between them, then the distance between these points is $2$. If these points were endpoints of a side of a square, the side length would be $2$, and its area would be $A = 2^2 = 4$.

**Step 3: Consider the longest possible square side on this grid**

If we take two points that are on opposite corners of the smallest square on the grid, the distance between these points is $3$. If these were endpoints of a side of a square, the side length would be $3$, and its area would be $A = 3^2 = 9$.

**Step 4: Look for any other possibilities**

For any set of four points to form a square, the distance between the two pairs of opposite vertices should be the same. This is because the diagonal splits the square into two 45-45-90 triangles, making the two diagonals congruent. Thus, all possible squares would have been covered by the previous three steps.

Also, since $\angle CXY = 64^\circ$ and again, $WXYZ$ is a rectangle, then $\angle YXC = 90^\circ - 64^\circ = 26^\circ$.

Since $D$ and $E$ are midpoints, $DE$ is parallel to $BC$ and hence, its slope is 0 (horizontal line).

The equation of line $DE$ is:
\[ y = 3 \]

Substituting this into the equation of line $AC$ to get the x-coordinate of $F$:
\[ 3 = -\frac{3}{4}x + 6 \]
\[ -\frac{3}{4}x = -3 \]
\[ x = 4 \]
So, $F$ has coordinates $(4,3)$.

**Step 4:** Calculate the areas of triangles and subtract to find the area of quadrilateral $DBEF$.
\[ \text{Area of triangle } ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times BC = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8 = 24 \]
\[ \text{Area of triangle } AFC = \frac{1}{2} \times AF \times FC \]
Where:
\[ AF = \sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (3-6)^2} = 3\sqrt{5} \]
\[ FC = \sqrt{(8-4)^2 + (0-3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = 5 \]

Thus:
\[ \text{Area of triangle } AFC = \frac{1}{2} \times 3\sqrt{5} \times 5 = \frac{15\sqrt{5}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Area of quadrilateral } DBEF = \text{Area of triangle } ABC - \text{Area of triangle } AFC \]
\[ = 24 - \frac{15\sqrt{5}}{2} \]

Therefore, the area of quadrilateral $DBEF$ is \( 24 - \frac{15\sqrt{5}}{2} \) square units.

To solve for the length of \( AB \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Given Information**:
   We're given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles since \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB \). Therefore, \( AB = AC \).

2. **Use the Perimeter Information**:
   The perimeter of the triangle is given to be 32. The perimeter is the sum of all the sides:
   \[ AB + AC + BC = 32 \]

3. **Substitute the Given Length**:
   Since \( BC = 12 \) and \( AB = AC \), let's say \( AB = AC = x \). So, 
   \[ x + x + 12 = 32 \]
   \[ 2x + 12 = 32 \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   Subtracting 12 from both sides:
   \[ 2x = 20 \]
   Dividing both sides by 2:
   \[ x = 10 \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   Since \( x \) represents the length of \( AB \), the length of \( AB \) is 10 units.

Thus, the length of \( AB \) is \( \boxed{10} \) units.

To find an equation of the circle passing through all three vertices of the triangle, we first need to find the coordinates of these vertices by determining the points of intersection of the given lines.

1. Intersection of \(y = -x - 1\) and \(x = 2\):
Substituting \(x = 2\) into the first equation, we get:
\[y = -2 - 1 = -3\]
So, the point of intersection is \((2, -3)\).

2. Intersection of \(y = -x - 1\) and \(y = \frac{1}{5}x + \frac{13}{5}\):
Setting the two equations equal, we get:
\[-x - 1 = \frac{1}{5}x + \frac{13}{5}\]
Multiplying everything by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[-5x - 5 = x + 13\]
Combining like terms:
\[-6x = 8\]
\[x = -\frac{4}{3}\]
Substituting this into one of our original equations (let's use the first), we get:
\[y = \frac{4}{3} - 1 = \frac{1}{3}\]
So, the point of intersection is \(-\frac{4}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\).

3. Intersection of \(x = 2\) and \(y = \frac{1}{5}x + \frac{13}{5}\):
Substituting \(x = 2\) into the second equation, we get:
\[y = \frac{1}{5} \cdot 2 + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3\]
So, the point of intersection is \((2, 3)\).

Now that we have the three vertices of the triangle, \((-4/3, 1/3)\), \((2, -3)\), and \((2, 3)\), we can use them to find the equation of the circle passing through them.

The general equation of a circle is:
\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \]
Where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \(r\) is its radius.

Using the above equation and our three points, we can set up a system of three equations to solve for \(h\), \(k\), and \(r^2\). 

However, a more efficient approach is to recognize that the perpendicular bisectors of the chords of a circle pass through the circle's center. 

Taking the midpoint and slope of the segment connecting the points \((-4/3, 1/3)\) and \((2, -3)\):
Midpoint: \(\left(\frac{2 - (-4/3)}{2}, \frac{-3 + 1/3}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{3}, -\frac{5}{3}\right)\)
Slope of segment: \(m = \frac{-3 - 1/3}{2 - (-4/3)} = -2\)
Perpendicular slope: \(m' = \frac{1}{2}\)

Using the point-slope form:
\[ y + \frac{5}{3} = \frac{1}{2} (x - \frac{2}{3}) \]

Doing a similar calculation for the segment connecting the points \((-4/3, 1/3)\) and \((2, 3)\):
Midpoint: \(\left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{10}{3}\right)\)
Slope of segment: \(m = \frac{3 - 1/3}{2 + 4/3} = \frac{3/2}\)
Perpendicular slope: \(m' = -\frac{2}{3}\)

Using the point-slope form:
\[ y - \frac{10}{3} = -\frac{2}{3} (x - \frac{2}{3}) \]

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give the center of the circle. Solving this system:
We get the center, \(h, k\), as \(\left(\frac{10}{7}, -\frac{11}{7}\right)\).

Using the distance formula with one of the points to get the radius:
\[ r = \sqrt{\left(2 - \frac{10}{7}\right)^2 + \left(-3 + \frac{11}{7}\right)^2} = \frac{8\sqrt{2}}{7} \]

Finally, plugging these into our general circle equation, we get:
\[ (x - \frac{10}{7})^2 + (y + \frac{11}{7})^2 = \frac{128}{49} \]

From the given data:

\( MB = AN - 2.4 \) (since \( AN = MN + 2.4 \))

Substituting these values in the above equation, we get:
\[ \frac{2.4}{BN} = \frac{8}{BN + 2.4} \]

Cross-multiplying, we have:
\[ 2.4(BN + 2.4) = 8(BN) \]
\[ 2.4BN + 5.76 = 8BN \]
\[ 5.6BN = 5.76 \]

Given that:
\[ \text{base} = QR = 8 \]

\[ \text{Area of } \triangle PRQ = 48 \times \sqrt{3}/2 \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle PRQ = 48\sqrt{3}/2 = 24\sqrt{3} \]

**Step 2**: Calculate $RS$ using the Pythagoras theorem.
In right triangle $PRS$, $PR^2 = PS^2 + RS^2$

Given $PR = 12$, and using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle (since $\angle PRQ$ is 120°, $\angle RPS$ will be 60°):
\[ PS = 2 \times RS \]
\[ PR = \sqrt{RS^2 + 4RS^2} \]
\[ 12^2 = 5RS^2 \]
\[ RS^2 = 28.8 \]
\[ RS = \sqrt{28.8} = 2\sqrt{7.2} = 2(2.68) \]
\[ RS = 5.36 \]

**Step 3**: Calculate the area of $\triangle RPS$.
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle RPS = \frac{1}{2} \times RS \times PS \]
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle RPS = \frac{1}{2} \times 5.36 \times (2 \times 5.36) \]

To determine the area of trapezoid \(WXYZ\), we need to determine the lengths of \(WY\) and \(WX\). We will use the properties of right triangles and the given information to find these lengths.

1. For right triangle \(WYZ\):

Given that \(YZ = 12\) and \(\tan Z = 1.5\),

\(\tan Z = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\)

\(1.5 = \frac{WY}{YZ}\)

\(1.5 = \frac{WY}{12}\)

Therefore, \(WY = 1.5 \times 12 = 18\).

2. For right triangle \(WXY\):

Since \(\overline{WX}\parallel \overline{ZY}\), \(ZX\) is also \(12\) units in length (from the properties of a trapezoid with one pair of opposite sides parallel).

Given that \(\tan X = 3\),

\(\tan X = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\)

\(3 = \frac{WY}{ZX}\)

\(3 = \frac{WY}{12}\)

But we've already found \(WY\) to be \(18\) in the previous step. So this confirms that our calculation is consistent.

3. Now, let's find \(WX\):

Since \(WY\) is the height of the trapezoid and is perpendicular to both bases, the length of \(WX\) can be determined by using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle \(WXY\).

In triangle \(WXY\):

\(WY^2 + ZX^2 = WX^2\)

\(18^2 + 12^2 = WX^2\)

\(324 + 144 = WX^2\)

\(468 = WX^2\)

Therefore, \(WX = \sqrt{468}\)

Simplifying,

\(WX = 2\sqrt{117}\)
\(WX = 2(3\sqrt{13})\)
\(WX = 6\sqrt{13}\)

4. Finally, to find the area of the trapezoid:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{sum of bases}) \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (YZ + WX) \times WY \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (12 + 6\sqrt{13}) \times 18 \]
\[ \text{Area} = 9 \times (12 + 6\sqrt{13}) \]
\[ \text{Area} = 108 + 54\sqrt{13} \]

The area of trapezoid \(WXYZ\) is \(108 + 54\sqrt{13}\) square units.

Step 1: Find the diagonal of square ABCD.
The diagonal of a square is given by the formula: \[d = s\sqrt{2}\]
where \(d\) is the diagonal and \(s\) is the side of the square.

First, we need to find the side length of square ABCD.

Step 2: Determine the side length of square ABCD.
The side length of square ABCD is the diagonal of one of the small squares (for instance, WX). Since the side of the small square is 2, its diagonal is: 
\[WX = 2\sqrt{2}\]

Therefore, the side of square ABCD is also \(2\sqrt{2}\).

Step 3: Using the side length of square ABCD, find its diagonal.
Using the formula from step 1, the diagonal of square ABCD (which is the distance from A to C) is: 
\[AC = 2\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2} = 4\]

Step 4: Find the distance from C to P.
This is half the side of the large square minus one side of the small square: 
\[CP = \frac{6}{2} - 2 = 1\]

Step 5: Combine the lengths to find the total distance from A to P.
The distance from A to P is the sum of the diagonal of square ABCD and the distance from C to P:
\[AP = AC + CP = 4 + 1 = 5\]

So, the maximum possible distance from A to P is \(5\) units.

Where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

Given the cylinder has a radius \( r = \sqrt{3} \) and height \( h = 10 \), 
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (\sqrt{3})^2 \times 10 \]
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = 30\pi \]

### Cone:
2. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cone is given by:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]
Where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone.

Given the cone has the same base radius \( r = \sqrt{3} \) and height \( h = 10 \) as the cylinder, 
\[ V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (\sqrt{3})^2 \times 10 \]
\[ V_{\text{cone}} = 10\pi \]

### Combined Volume:
Now, combining the volumes of the cylinder and the cone:
\[ V_{\text{total}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} + V_{\text{cone}} \]
\[ V_{\text{total}} = 30\pi + 10\pi \]
\[ V_{\text{total}} = 40\pi \]

To solve for \( x \), we'll start by determining the unknown angles within the triangle.

Since \( \triangle PQR \) is isosceles, the angles opposite the two equal sides will also be equal. Given that \( \angle P = 40^\circ \), then:
\[ \angle Q = \angle R \]

Now, the sum of the angles in any triangle is always \( 180^\circ \). Therefore:
\[ \angle P + \angle Q + \angle R = 180^\circ \]
\[ 40^\circ + \angle Q + \angle R = 180^\circ \]

Using our previous observation that \( \angle Q \) and \( \angle R \) are equal:
\[ 40^\circ + 2\angle Q = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2\angle Q = 140^\circ \]
\[ \angle Q = 70^\circ \]

So, \( \angle Q \) and \( \angle R \) are each \( 70^\circ \).

Now, for the angle \( x \) outside the triangle, it is an exterior angle for \( \triangle PQR \) at vertex \( R \). The measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

Thus:
\[ x = \angle P + \angle Q \]
\[ x = 40^\circ + 70^\circ \]
\[ x = 110^\circ \]

Therefore, \( x = 110^\circ \).

The radius of one quarter-circle is given as 3 units. The area of a full circle with this radius is:
\[ \text{Area of circle} = \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi \text{ square units} \]
Since we are looking at a quarter of this circle, its area is:
\[ \text{Area of one quarter-circle} = \frac{1}{4} \times 9\pi = \frac{9\pi}{4} \text{ square units} \]

There are four such quarter-circles in the diagram, so their combined area is:
\[ \text{Area of four quarter-circles} = 4 \times \frac{9\pi}{4} = 9\pi \text{ square units} \]

4. **Area of the Shaded Region:** 
The shaded region is the area of the square minus the area of the four quarter-circles:
\[ \text{Area of shaded region} = 36 - 9\pi \text{ square units} \]
This is in the form \( a - b\pi \) where \( a = 36 \) and \( b = 9 \).

To find the perimeter of the trapezoid, we need to determine the lengths of its four sides. We are given the length of one base (the shorter one) as 5 inches, the altitude as \(2\sqrt{3}\) inches, and one of the angles as \(60^\circ\).

Let's begin by examining one of the triangles formed by the altitude. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the two triangles are congruent. We'll analyze the left triangle.

1. The triangle is a \(30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ\) triangle because the sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\) and the given angle is \(60^\circ\). This makes the angle adjacent to the altitude \(30^\circ\).

2. In a \(30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ\) triangle, the sides are in the ratio \(1 : \sqrt{3} : 2\). The shortest side (opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle) is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle (in this case, the altitude) is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the shortest side.

3. Using the given altitude length of \(2\sqrt{3}\) inches, and knowing that this side is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the shortest side, we can solve for the shortest side:
\[ x \times \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3} \]
\[ x = 2 \]
So, the shortest side (base of the triangle) is 2 inches.

4. The hypotenuse (longest side) is twice the length of the shortest side, so it's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches.

5. The longer base of the trapezoid is the sum of the shorter base and twice the shortest side of the triangle (since there are two such sides, one on each side of the trapezoid). So, its length is \(5 + 2(2) = 9\) inches.

Now that we have the lengths of all four sides of the trapezoid, we can find its perimeter:
\[ 5 + 9 + 4 + 4 = 22 \]
The perimeter of the trapezoid is \(22\) inches.

\[ XY^2 = h^2 + WZ^2 \]

Given:
\[ XY = 96 \]
\[ WZ = 104 - 32 = 72 \]

Plugging in these values:

\[ h^2 = 9216 - 5184 \]

Similarly, since E is the midpoint of AB, 
\[AE = \frac{1}{2} \times AB = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 = 7.5 \text{ units}.\]

To find DE, notice that triangle ADE is a right triangle (because triangle ABC is a right triangle). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[DE^2 = AD^2 + AE^2\]
\[DE^2 = 12^2 + 7.5^2 = 144 + 56.25 = 200.25\]
\[DE = \sqrt{200.25} = 14.15 \text{ units}.\]

Since F is the midpoint of BC, triangle CEF is similar to triangle CAB (they are both right triangles and share angle C). Given that F is the midpoint, the ratio of their sides is 1:2. Since AB = 15, 
\[EF = \frac{1}{2} \times AB = 7.5 \text{ units}.\]

Now, to find the area of triangle DEF, use the formula:
\[\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\]

Let DE be the base. To find the height, drop a perpendicular from F to DE, and call the foot of this perpendicular G.

Triangle DFE is similar to triangle DAE. Since DE is half of DA, the ratio of their sides is 1:2. So,
\[FG = \frac{1}{2} \times AE = \frac{1}{2} \times 7.5 = 3.75 \text{ units}.\]

Thus, the area of triangle DEF is:
\[\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14.15 \times 3.75 = 26.53 \text{ square units}.\]

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Unit Cubes:** 
The entire cube has dimensions $5\times 5\times 5$, so it is composed of $5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$ unit cubes.

2. **Count the Painted Unit Cubes on One Face:** 
The pattern shown in the image is symmetrical, so each face will have the same number of painted unit cubes. 
Counting the painted unit squares on the given face, we see that there are 13 gray squares.

3. **Counting for All Faces:**
Since there are 6 faces on a cube and each face has 13 painted squares, there are a total of $6 \times 13 = 78$ unit cubes painted if we painted each face separately. 

4. **Account for Overcounting:** 
We've counted the edges and corners more than once. 
   - Each edge unit cube is counted 2 times (for the two faces it's on). There are 12 edges with 4 unit cubes on each edge (excluding the corners), so we've overcounted $12 \times 3 = 36$ unit cubes. 
   - Each corner unit cube is counted 3 times (for the three faces it's on). There are 8 corners, so we've overcounted 16 corner unit cubes.

   So, the total overcount is $36 + 16 = 52$ unit cubes. 

5. **Finding the Actual Number of Painted Unit Cubes:**
Subtracting the overcount from the total painted without accounting for overlap, we get:
$78 - 52 = 26$ unit cubes that are actually painted.

6. **Finding the Number of Unpainted Unit Cubes:**
Now, subtracting the painted unit cubes from the total gives:
$125 - 26 = 99$ unpainted unit cubes.

7. **Calculate the Fraction:**
The fraction of unpainted unit cubes out of the total is:
$\frac{99}{125}$.

So, the fraction of the entire solid cube's unit cubes that have no paint on them is $\frac{99}{125}$.

Alright, let's calculate the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\).

One method to determine the area of such a shape is to divide it into simpler shapes whose areas are easier to calculate. Here, we can split \(ABCD\) into two triangles, \(ABC\) and \(ACD\). We can then find the areas of these triangles and sum them to obtain the area of \(ABCD\).

1. **Area of Triangle \(ABC\):**

We can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices: 
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} | x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) | \]
Where \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) are the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.

For triangle \(ABC\):
\(A(0,1) \rightarrow x_1 = 0, y_1 = 1\)
\(B(1,3) \rightarrow x_2 = 1, y_2 = 3\)
\(C(5,2) \rightarrow x_3 = 5, y_3 = 2\)

Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ \text{Area}_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} | 0(3 - 2) + 1(2 - 1) + 5(1 - 3) | \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} | 0 + 1 - 10 | \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ABC} = 4.5 \]

2. **Area of Triangle \(ACD\):**

Using the same formula for triangle \(ACD\):
\(A(0,1) \rightarrow x_1 = 0, y_1 = 1\)
\(C(5,2) \rightarrow x_2 = 5, y_2 = 2\)
\(D(4,0) \rightarrow x_3 = 4, y_3 = 0\)

Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ \text{Area}_{ACD} = \frac{1}{2} | 0(2 - 0) + 5(0 - 1) + 4(1 - 2) | \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ACD} = \frac{1}{2} | 0 - 5 - 4 | \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ACD} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ACD} = 4.5 \]

3. **Area of Quadrilateral \(ABCD\):**
\[ \text{Area}_{ABCD} = \text{Area}_{ABC} + \text{Area}_{ACD} \]
\[ \text{Area}_{ABCD} = 4.5 + 4.5 = 9 \]

So, the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is \(9 \text{ square units}\).

To determine the perimeter of $\triangle BDP$, we first need to determine the lengths of segments $\overline{BD}$, $\overline{DP}$, and $\overline{BP}$.

Let's break this problem down step by step:

**Step 1: Find the length of $\overline{BD}$**
Given that $\overline{AD} = 1$ and $\overline{ABCD}$ is a rectangle, it follows that $\overline{BC} = 1$. Since the diagonal of a rectangle bisects the rectangle, the length of $\overline{BD}$ will be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $1$ and $\overline{AB}$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2\]
Since $\overline{AB} = \overline{CD} = 1$ (because $ABCD$ is a rectangle) and $\overline{AD} = 1$:
\[BD^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2\]
\[BD = \sqrt{2}\]

**Step 2: Find the length of $\overline{DP}$**
Given that $\overline{DB}$ and $\overline{DP}$ trisect $\angle ADC$, it follows that $\angle ADP = \angle PDB$.

By using the Law of Sines on $\triangle ADP$:
\[\frac{\sin(\angle ADP)}{DP} = \frac{\sin(\angle APD)}{AD}\]
Given that $\angle ADP = \angle PDB$ and $\sin(\angle ADP) = \sin(\angle PDB)$:
\[\frac{\sin(\angle PDB)}{DP} = \frac{\sin(\angle APD)}{1}\]
To solve for $DP$, we need the value of $\sin(\angle APD)$, but because $\angle APD = \angle PDC$:
\[\sin(\angle APD) = \sin(\angle PDC) = \frac{CD}{BD} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\]
Substituting in:
\[\frac{\sin(\angle PDB)}{DP} = \frac{\sqrt{2}/2}{1}\]
\[DP \cdot \sin(\angle PDB) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\]
Since $\angle PDB$ and $\angle ADP$ are equal and sum to $90^\circ$, each of them is $45^\circ$. Therefore, $\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$:
\[DP \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\]
\[DP = 1\]

**Step 3: Find the length of $\overline{BP}$**
\[BP = BD + DP = \sqrt{2} + 1\]

**Step 4: Compute the perimeter of $\triangle BDP$**
\[BD + DP + BP = \sqrt{2} + 1 + \sqrt{2} + 1 = 2 + 2\sqrt{2} = 2 + \frac{2 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{1}\]
Thus, $w=2$, $x=2$, $y=2$, and $z=1$. 

The requested sum is:
\[w + x + y + z = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = \boxed{7}\].

To solve for the area of square \(EFGH\), we can use the given area of square \(ABCD\) and the length \(AE\).

**Step 1:** Compute the side length of square \(ABCD\).
The area of square \(ABCD\) is given to be 100 square centimeters. The area of a square is \(s^2\), where \(s\) is the side length. Therefore:
\[s^2 = 100\]
\[s = 10\]
So, each side of square \(ABCD\) is 10 cm.

**Step 2:** Compute the length of \(EH\).
Since \(AE = 2\) cm and \(AE\) is a part of side \(AD\), we can deduce the length of \(EH\). Given that \(AD = 10\) cm (from Step 1):
\[EH = AD - AE = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ cm}\]

**Step 3:** Use the Pythagorean Theorem to compute \(EF\).
The line segment \(EH\) is one of the sides of square \(EFGH\), and it's also a diagonal of square \(ABCD\). Using the Pythagorean Theorem:
\[EF^2 + EF^2 = EH^2\]
\[2EF^2 = 64\]
\[EF^2 = 32\]
\[EF = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\]

**Step 4:** Compute the area of square \(EFGH\).
\[Area = (4\sqrt{2})^2 = 32 \text{ square centimeters}\]

So, the area of square \(EFGH\) is \(32\) square centimeters.

To determine the area of the hexagon \( AOBCPD \), we can break it down into multiple, more manageable sections: two sectors and two triangles.

**Step 1: Area of Sectors**
We begin with the sectors. The sectors \( AOB \) and \( DPC \) are 60-degree sectors of their respective circles because the tangent lines form a common external tangent, and therefore, are equidistant from the point of tangency to the centers of the circles.

For the circle centered at \( O \):

\[ \text{Area of sector } AOB = \frac{60}{360} \times \pi(2^2) = \frac{1}{6} \times 4\pi = \frac{2}{3}\pi \]

For the circle centered at \( P \):

\[ \text{Area of sector } DPC = \frac{60}{360} \times \pi(4^2) = \frac{1}{6} \times 16\pi = \frac{8}{3}\pi \]

**Step 2: Area of Triangles**
Now we determine the area of the triangles. The triangles \( AOO' \) and \( DPP' \) are right triangles. Let \( O' \) and \( P' \) be the feet of the perpendiculars from \( O \) and \( P \) to \( AD \) and \( BC \) respectively. 

For triangle \( AOO' \), the height is 2 (radius of circle \( O \)) and the base \( OO' \) is half the distance between the two circle centers, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \). So:

\[ \text{Area of triangle } AOO' = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 3 = 3 \]

For triangle \( DPP' \), the height is 4 (radius of circle \( P \)) and the base \( PP' \) is \( 3 \) (the same as \( OO' \)). So:

\[ \text{Area of triangle } DPP' = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3 = 6 \]

**Step 3: Summing Up**

Adding all the areas together:

\[ \text{Area of hexagon } AOBCPD = \frac{2}{3}\pi + \frac{8}{3}\pi + 3 + 6 \]
\[ = \frac{10}{3}\pi + 9 \]

So, the area of the hexagon \( AOBCPD \) is \( \frac{10}{3}\pi + 9 \) square units.

To solve for \( x \), we will make use of the properties of alternate angles and the fact that angles on a straight line sum to \( 180^\circ \).

Let's break it down step-by-step:

**Step 1:** Since \( PRT \) is a straight line, the angle \( \angle PRQ = 180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ \).

**Step 2:** \( PQ \) is a transversal line that intersects the parallel lines \( PR \) and \( ST \). Thus, the angles \( \angle QPR \) and \( \angle QSR \) are alternate angles. This means \( \angle QSR = 140^\circ \).

**Step 3:** Since \( QRS \) is a straight line, the angle \( \angle QRT = 180^\circ - 140^\circ = 40^\circ \).

**Step 4:** \( QR \) is a transversal line that intersects the parallel lines \( PR \) and \( ST \). Thus, the angles \( \angle QRT \) and \( \angle RTS \) are alternate angles. This means \( \angle RTS = 40^\circ \).

**Step 5:** Since \( PRT \) is a straight line, we have:
\[ \angle PRT = 180^\circ - x^\circ - 40^\circ \]
\[ \angle PRT = 140^\circ - x^\circ \]

**Step 6:** \( PR \) is a transversal line that intersects the parallel lines \( PQ \) and \( TS \). Thus, the angles \( \angle PRT \) and \( \angle PSQ \) are alternate angles. This means:
\[ \angle PSQ = 140^\circ - x^\circ \]

**Step 7:** Using the fact that \( QRS \) is a straight line, we have:
\[ \angle PSQ + \angle QSR = 180^\circ \]
\[ 140^\circ - x^\circ + 140^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 280^\circ - x^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ -x^\circ = -100^\circ \]

\[ x = 100^\circ \]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) is \( 100^\circ \).

Alright! Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

1. The given diagram indicates that $\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$. This makes $\angle BAC$ and $\angle BCA$ alternate interior angles.

2. Alternate interior angles are equal when two lines are parallel and intersected by a transversal. Therefore, $\angle BCA = 124^\circ$.

3. Since triangle ABC is isosceles (given that $AB = BC$), the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. This means $\angle BAC = \angle ABC$.

4. We know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is $180^\circ$.

Using this information:
$\angle BAC + \angle ABC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ$

Given that:
$\angle BAC = \angle ABC = x$ 
and 
$\angle BCA = 124^\circ$

Substituting in the given values:
$x + x + 124^\circ = 180^\circ$

Combining like terms:
$2x = 56^\circ$

Dividing both sides by 2:
$x = 28^\circ$

So, $x$ is equal to \(28^\circ\).

To determine the area of quadrilateral \(DRQC\), we first need to find the lengths of segments \(DP\), \(DQ\), and \(RQ\).

1. **Determine \(DP\):**
When the paper is folded so that \(CD\) lies along \(AD\), the triangle \(DPC\) is a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 8 cm (the length of segment \(AD\)). Since \(CD\) and \(AD\) are both 8 cm, the triangle is also isosceles, which means \(DP\) and \(CP\) have the same length. To find the length of \(DP\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
Let \(DP = x\).
\(x^2 + x^2 = 8^2\)
\(2x^2 = 64\)
\(x^2 = 32\)
\(x = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\)

So, \(DP = 4\sqrt{2}\) cm.

2. **Determine \(DQ\):**
When the paper is folded so that \(AB\) lies along \(AD\), the triangle \(DAQ\) is another right triangle with hypotenuse \(AD\) (8 cm). The other leg \(AQ\) has length 3 cm (since \(AB\) = 5 cm and \(AD\) = 8 cm, and \(AB\) lies on \(AD\)). Again, using the Pythagorean theorem:
Let \(DQ = y\).
\(y^2 + 3^2 = 8^2\)
\(y^2 + 9 = 64\)
\(y^2 = 55\)
\(y = \sqrt{55}\)

So, \(DQ = \sqrt{55}\) cm.

3. **Determine \(RQ\):**
Now, note that triangle \(DPR\) is similar to triangle \(DAR\). Using the similar triangles, we can set up a proportion to determine \(RQ\):
\(\frac{RQ}{DP} = \frac{AQ}{AD}\)
Given that \(DP = 4\sqrt{2}\) and \(AQ = 3\), and \(AD = 8\), we get:
\(RQ = \frac{3 \times 4\sqrt{2}}{8}\)
\(RQ = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \times 4\)
\(RQ = 6\sqrt{2}\)

Now, to determine the area of quadrilateral \(DRQC\), we'll sum the areas of triangle \(DRP\) and trapezoid \(PQRC\).

**Area of \(DRP\):**
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times DP \times DQ \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{55} \]
\[ = 2\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{55} \]
\[ = 2\sqrt{110} \]

**Area of trapezoid \(PQRC\):**
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times (DP + DQ) \times RQ \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2} \times (4\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{55}) \times 6\sqrt{2} \]
\[ = 3\sqrt{2} \times (4\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{55}) \]
\[ = 24 + 3\sqrt{110} \]

Adding the two areas together:
\[ 2\sqrt{110} + 24 + 3\sqrt{110} \]
\[ = 24 + 5\sqrt{110} \]

Thus, the area of quadrilateral \(DRQC\) is \[ 24 + 5\sqrt{110} \] \(\mbox{cm}^2\).

To find the distance from point \(P\) to point \(Q\), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.

1. Start by determining the dimensions of the rectangular box. We know that:
   - The height (thickness) is 8 cm.
   - The dimensions of the square base are 32 cm by 32 cm.

2. Determine the distances involved:
   - The distance from the center of the square to a side (half the length of a side) is \( \frac{32 \text{ cm}}{2} = 16 \text{ cm} \).
   - The distance from point \(P\) to the center of the opposite square base is 8 cm (since that's the thickness of the box).

3. Using the Pythagorean theorem in two dimensions:
   We first find the distance from the center of one square base to a corner (this is a diagonal of the square base). Let's call this distance \(d_1\).
   \[ d_1^2 = 16^2 + 16^2 \]
   \[ d_1^2 = 256 + 256 \]
   \[ d_1^2 = 512 \]
   \[ d_1 = \sqrt{512} \]
   \[ d_1 = 16\sqrt{2} \text{ cm} \]

4. Now, to find the distance from \(P\) to \(Q\), we can think of this as the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one side is the distance from \(P\) to the center of the opposite square base (8 cm) and the other side is \(d_1\). Let's call this distance \(d_2\).

   Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[ d_2^2 = (16\sqrt{2})^2 + 8^2 \]
   \[ d_2^2 = 512 + 64 \]
   \[ d_2^2 = 576 \]
   \[ d_2 = 24 \text{ cm} \]

So, the distance from point \(P\) to point \(Q\) is \( \boxed{24 \text{ cm}} \).

To determine the area of quadrilateral \( KSEM \), we will first find the areas of the three shaded regions formed by the semi-circles and then subtract the areas of the two smaller semi-circles from the largest semi-circle.

**Step 1:** Determine the radii of the three semi-circles.

- The radius \( AK \) of the largest semi-circle is \( AK + KO + OC + CM + MB = 2(OC + CM + MB) \) because \( AK = KB \). We know \( OC = 32 \) and \( CB = 36 \), so \( CM = \frac{1}{2} \times CB = 18 \) and \( MB = 18 \). Thus, \( AK = 2(32 + 18 + 18) = 136 \) units.
  
- The radius \( KO \) of the middle semi-circle is \( KO + OC = OC = 32 \) units.

- The radius \( MC \) of the smallest semi-circle is \( CM = 18 \) units.

**Step 2:** Find the lengths \( KS \) and \( ME \).

To find the length of \( KS \), we need to know that the line segment \( l \) is tangent to the middle semi-circle at point \( S \). This means that \( KS \) is perpendicular to \( l \) and \( KS \) is the radius of the middle semi-circle, so \( KS = 32 \) units.

Similarly, \( ME \) is the radius of the smallest semi-circle, so \( ME = 18 \) units.

**Step 3:** Find the area of triangle \( KSO \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length \( OS \) since \( KS \) and \( KO \) are the two legs of a right triangle and \( OS \) is the hypotenuse.

\[ OS^2 = KS^2 + KO^2 \]
\[ OS^2 = 32^2 + 32^2 \]
\[ OS^2 = 2048 \]
\[ OS = \sqrt{2048} = 32\sqrt{2} \]

The area of triangle \( KSO \) is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times KO \times KS = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 \times 32 = 512 \] square units.

**Step 4:** Find the area of triangle \( MEO \).

Similar to the previous step, we find:
\[ MO = \sqrt{18^2 + 32^2} = \sqrt{324 + 1024} = \sqrt{1348} = 2\sqrt{337} \]

The area of triangle \( MEO \) is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times ME \times MO = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 \times 2\sqrt{337} = 18\sqrt{337} \] square units.

**Step 5:** Determine the area of quadrilateral \( KSEM \).

The area of quadrilateral \( KSEM \) is the area of the largest semi-circle minus the areas of triangles \( KSO \) and \( MEO \) and the areas of the two smaller semi-circles.

\[ \text{Area of } KSEM = \frac{1}{2} \pi (136^2) - 512 - 18\sqrt{337} - \frac{1}{2} \pi (32^2) - \frac{1}{2} \pi (18^2) \]

\[ = \frac{1}{2} \pi (18496 - 1024 - 324) - 512 - 18\sqrt{337} \]

\[ = \frac{1}{2} \pi (17148) - 512 - 18\sqrt{337} \]

\[ = 8574\pi - 512 - 18\sqrt{337} \] square units.

Alright, let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Understanding the problem** 
When the semi-circle rocks, the points where it touches the line above are the end-points of the diameter that's perpendicular to the line. As the semi-circle rocks back and forth, the diameter moves along the semi-circle, touching the line above at different points. The two extreme points it touches are at the two ends of the semi-circle. 

**Step 2: Drawing a representative figure** 
Consider one end of the semi-circle where it touches the line above. Let's draw a radius to that point. This radius will be perpendicular to the diameter we discussed. Thus, it forms a right-angled triangle.

**Step 3: Labeling the triangle**
Let the center of the semi-circle be \(O\). The point where the radius touches the line above is \(A\), and the point where this radius meets the diameter is \(B\).

**Step 4: Calculating lengths**
Given that the radius \(OA\) is 8 cm and \(OB\) is also 8 cm (because it's a radius too). The distance between the line on which the semi-circle sits and the line above is 12 cm. 

So, the length \(AB\) is 12 cm - 8 cm = 4 cm.

**Step 5: Using Pythagoras theorem** 
In right triangle \(OAB\),
\[ OA^2 = OB^2 + AB^2 \]

Given,
\[ OA = 8 \text{ cm} \]
\[ OB = 8 \text{ cm} \]
\[ AB = 4 \text{ cm} \]

Substituting in the above equation, we get:
\[ 8^2 = 8^2 + 4^2 \]
\[ 64 = 64 + AB^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 0 \]
\[ AB = 0 \]

This doesn't make sense. Our mistake was in the application of the Pythagoras theorem. Since the diameter is moving, \(OB\) isn't the maximum 8 cm when it touches the line above. Let's call this length \(x\).

Using the Pythagoras theorem correctly:
\[ 8^2 = x^2 + 4^2 \]
\[ 64 = x^2 + 16 \]
\[ x^2 = 48 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{48} \]
\[ x = 4\sqrt{3} \text{ cm} \]

So, the distance from the center \(O\) to the point where the diameter touches the line above is \(8 - 4\sqrt{3}\) cm.

Now, to find the distance between the two extreme points where the semi-circle touches the line above, we double this value:

\[ 2(8 - 4\sqrt{3}) \text{ cm} \]
\[ = 16 - 8\sqrt{3} \text{ cm} \]

Now, rounding off to the nearest whole number in millimeters:
\[ (16 - 8\sqrt{3}) \times 10 \text{ mm} \]
\[ \approx 86 \text{ mm} \]

So, the distance between the two points is approximately \(86\) millimeters.

The frustum can be visualized as a larger cone from which a smaller cone has been cut off. The slant height of the larger cone, \(L_1\), and the smaller cone, \(L_2\), can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem. 

For the larger cone:

\[ L_1^2 = 20^2 + 10^2 \]
\[ L_1^2 = 400 + 100 \]
\[ L_1^2 = 500 \]
\[ L_1 = \sqrt{500} = 10\sqrt{5} \]

For the smaller cone:

\[ L_2^2 = 12^2 + 4^2 \]
\[ L_2^2 = 144 + 16 \]
\[ L_2^2 = 160 \]
\[ L_2 = \sqrt{160} = 4\sqrt{10} \]

Now, to find \(L\), the slant height of the frustum:

\[ L = L_1 - L_2 \]
\[ L = 10\sqrt{5} - 4\sqrt{10} \]

2. **Find the Lateral Surface Area of the Frustum**

Given the formula for the lateral surface area of a frustum:

\[ A_{lateral} = \frac{1}{2} \times L \times (C_1 + C_2) \]
Where \( C_1 \) is the circumference of the larger base and \( C_2 \) is the circumference of the smaller base.

\[ C_1 = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \]
\[ C_2 = 2\pi \times 4 = 8\pi \]

Plugging in the values we get:

\[ A_{lateral} = \frac{1}{2} \times (10\sqrt{5} - 4\sqrt{10}) \times (20\pi + 8\pi) \]
\[ A_{lateral} = (10\sqrt{5} - 4\sqrt{10}) \times 14\pi \]

3. **Find the Surface Area of the Two Bases**

\[ A_{base1} = \pi \times 10^2 = 100\pi \]
\[ A_{base2} = \pi \times 4^2 = 16\pi \]

4. **Total Surface Area of the Frustum**

\[ A_{total} = A_{lateral} + A_{base1} + A_{base2} \]
\[ A_{total} = (10\sqrt{5} - 4\sqrt{10}) \times 14\pi + 100\pi + 16\pi \]
\[ A_{total} = 116\pi + (10\sqrt{5} - 4\sqrt{10}) \times 14\pi \]

So, the total surface area of the frustum in terms of \(\pi\) is:

\[ A_{total} = 116\pi + (10\sqrt{5} - 4\sqrt{10}) \times 14\pi \]

**4. Breaking Down the Shaded Area:**
The shaded area is made up of:
   - The sector of the larger circle between A, D, and C.
   - The region inside the smaller circle, which is outside the sector of the smaller circle between A, D, and C.

Let \(x\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. 

The sector area of a circle with angle \(x\) and radius \(r\) is \(\frac{x}{360} \times \pi r^2\).

Using this formula, the area of the sector ADC in the larger circle is \(\frac{x}{360} \times \pi (2^2) = \frac{x}{90} \pi\).

Similarly, the area of the sector ADC in the smaller circle is \(\frac{x}{360} \times \pi (1^2) = \frac{x}{360} \pi\).

Hence, the shaded area outside the smaller circle but within the larger circle is:
\(\frac{x}{90} \pi - \frac{x}{360} \pi = \frac{x}{120} \pi\).

The area of the shaded region inside the smaller circle is the total area of the smaller circle minus the sector ADC of the smaller circle:
\(\pi - \frac{x}{360} \pi = \frac{360-x}{360} \pi = \frac{360-x}{360} \pi\).

**5. Setting Up the Equation:**
The total shaded area is the sum of the two regions described above:
\(\frac{x}{120} \pi + \frac{360-x}{360} \pi = \frac53 \pi\).

Multiplying every term by 360 to get rid of the denominators, we get:
\(3x + 360 - x = 600\).

This simplifies to:
\(2x = 240\)
\(x = 120\).

So, \(\angle ADC\) measures \(120\) degrees.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, let's identify all the sides of the decagon. 

2. Starting from the bottom left vertex and moving clockwise:

- The first side is the bottom horizontal side, which is given to be 12 units.
- The second side is the vertical side on the left, which is given to be 8 units.
- The third side is the small horizontal side on the top left, which we don't have the length for yet.
- The fourth side is the long vertical side on the left. To find its length, subtract the length of the third side (which we'll find soon) from 8 units.
- The fifth side is the top horizontal side, given to be 2 units.
- The sixth side is the short vertical side on the top right. This is the difference between the height of the fourth side and the height of the third side.
- The seventh side is the middle horizontal side. To find its length, subtract 2 (the length of the fifth side) from 12, which gives 10 units.
- The eighth side is another vertical side on the right. Its length is equal to the length of the sixth side.
- The ninth side is the lower horizontal side on the right. Its length is equal to the length of the third side.
- The tenth side is the bottommost vertical side on the right. Its length is equal to the height of the fourth side minus the height of the sixth side.

3. From the given diagram, the total height is 8 units. If we subtract the topmost horizontal length of 2 units, we get 6 units for the combined lengths of the third, fourth, sixth, and tenth sides. 

4. The third and ninth sides are of equal length. Let's call this length x. Therefore, the combined length of the fourth and tenth sides is 6 - 2x.

5. But we know that the length of the fourth side is 8 units minus x, so the length of the tenth side is also 8 units minus x. This means:
2(8 - x) = 6 - 2x
=> 16 - 2x = 6 - 2x
=> 16 = 6
This is not possible, so there seems to be an inconsistency in the diagram or information provided.

Assuming the information given in the image is all we have, and we've interpreted it correctly, it's not possible to determine the exact perimeter of the decagon. We would need additional information or clarification to solve the problem accurately.

Alright, let's break this down step-by-step.

**Step 1:** First, recognize that an arc's measure is the same as the measure of the central angle that intercepts it. So, if we want to find the measure of minor arc \( RS \), we need to find the measure of angle \( ROS \).

**Step 2:** From the problem, we know that angle \( RTB \) is 28 degrees. But because the line \( OT \) is a radius of the circle and \( BT \) is a tangent to the circle at point \( T \), angle \( RTB \) is a right angle (or 90 degrees). Hence, \( RTO = 90 - 28 = 62 \) degrees.

**Step 3:** Now, let's find the measure of angle \( SOT \). Since angles on a straight line sum to 180 degrees, we have:
\[ ROB + BOR + RTO = 180 \]

From the problem, we know that:
\[ ROB = 3 \times SOT \]

Substituting in the above equation:
\[ 3SOT + SOT + 62 = 180 \]
\[ 4SOT = 118 \]
\[ SOT = 29.5 \] degrees

**Step 4:** Using the information from Step 3:
\[ ROB = 3 \times 29.5 = 88.5 \] degrees

**Step 5:** Now, to find the measure of angle \( ROS \):
\[ ROS = ROB - RTO = 88.5 - 62 = 26.5 \] degrees

So, the measure of minor arc \( RS \) is \( 26.5 \) degrees.

Alright, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Splitting the Belt's Length**
The belt that is wrapped around the circles can be divided into three parts:
1. The arc lengths from each circle.
2. The straight segments in between the circles.

**Step 2: Find the Arc Length**
Each circle contributes an arc of $120^\circ$ to the length of the belt, since it covers one third of the circle.
The formula to find the arc length (s) is given by:
\[ s = r \times \theta \]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle.
- \( \theta \) is the angle in radians.

To convert 120 degrees to radians, we multiply by \( \frac{\pi}{180} \):
\[ 120 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \]

Now, the arc length (s) of each circle will be:
\[ s = 10 \times \frac{2\pi}{3} = \frac{20\pi}{3} \]

Since there are three such arcs, the total arc length will be:
\[ 3 \times \frac{20\pi}{3} = 20\pi \]

**Step 3: Find the Length of Straight Segments**
To find the length of one straight segment, we'll first identify the triangle formed by the centers of the three circles. This is an equilateral triangle with a side length of 20 cm (since the diameter of one circle is 20 cm).

Drawing an altitude from one vertex of the equilateral triangle to its opposite side, we split the equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles. Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, the length of the altitude (which corresponds to the height of our straight segment) is:
\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 20 = 10\sqrt{3} \]

However, the belt only covers the portion of the altitude outside the circles, which is:
\[ h - 10 \]
(where 10 cm is the radius of one circle)

So, the length of one straight segment is:
\[ 10\sqrt{3} - 10 \]

Since there are three such segments, the total length of the straight segments is:
\[ 3(10\sqrt{3} - 10) = 30\sqrt{3} - 30 \]

**Step 4: Summing Up the Arc Length and Straight Segments**
The total length of the belt is:
\[ 20\pi + 30\sqrt{3} - 30 \]

The question asks us to express this in the form \( a + b\pi \). It's already in this form where:
\[ a = 30\sqrt{3} - 30 \]
\[ b = 20 \]

Thus, \( a + b = 30\sqrt{3} - 30 + 20 = 30\sqrt{3} - 10 \)

Now, if we rationalize \( \sqrt{3} \), we get approximately 1.732. Multiplying this by 30, we get:
\[ 30 \times 1.732 = 51.96 \]

So, \( a + b \) is approximately:
\[ 51.96 - 10 = 41.96 \]

Hence, the value of \( a + b \) is approximately \( 41.96 \).

Alright, let's solve this step by step:

**Step 1: Find the length of one side of the hexagon.**

Since $\overline{AC}$ is the longest diagonal of the hexagon and is made up of two sides of the hexagon, we can say:
\[ \text{Side of hexagon} = \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ units} \]

**Step 2: Find the height of one equilateral triangle.**

For an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the height (let's call it $h$) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ h^2 + \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = s^2 \]
\[ h^2 = s^2 - \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = s^2 - \frac{s^2}{4} = \frac{3s^2}{4} \]
\[ h = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Given that $s = 1.5$ units, the height $h$ of one of the triangles is:
\[ h = \frac{1.5\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0.75\sqrt{3} \text{ units} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle.**

The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{s \times h}{2} = \frac{s \times s\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4} \]

Substituting in our side length of 1.5 units:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{(1.5^2)\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{2.25\sqrt{3}}{4} = 0.5625\sqrt{3} \text{ square units} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the area of the hexagon.**

The area of the hexagon can be found by subtracting the area of the six triangles from the area of the larger equilateral triangle formed by $\overline{AC}$.
\[ \text{Area of larger triangle} = \frac{3^2\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
\[ \text{Total area of six smaller triangles} = 6 \times 0.5625\sqrt{3} = 3.375\sqrt{3} \]
\[ \text{Area of hexagon} = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4} - 3.375\sqrt{3} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
But area cannot be negative, so our approach to finding the area of the hexagon using the difference method was flawed.

Alternatively, we can find the area of the hexagon by summing up the areas of 6 trapezoids. Each trapezoid consists of one side of the hexagon and the height we found earlier.
\[ \text{Area of one trapezoid} = \frac{1.5 + 1.5}{2} \times 0.75\sqrt{3} = 1.125\sqrt{3} \]
\[ \text{Area of hexagon} = 6 \times 1.125\sqrt{3} = 6.75\sqrt{3} \text{ square units} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total area of the star.**

The star consists of the hexagon and six equilateral triangles. 
\[ \text{Total area} = 6.75\sqrt{3} + 6(0.5625\sqrt{3}) = 6.75\sqrt{3} + 3.375\sqrt{3} = 10.125\sqrt{3} \text{ square units} \]

**Answer:**
The area of the entire star is \( 10.125\sqrt{3} \) square units.

Let's begin by visualizing the problem and understanding the structure of the pyramid.

Given:
1. The pyramid has a square base.
2. All eight edges of the pyramid are of the same length.

Let's denote the common length of the edges as \( s \).

To determine the degree measure of angle \( ABD \), we can use the properties of the right triangle \( ABD \). Notice that triangle \( ABD \) is a right triangle, with \( AD \) being the hypotenuse.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Find \( AD \) using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle \( ADE \)**:
   Triangle \( ADE \) is also a right triangle. We have:
   \( AE = s \) (given, as all edges are equal in length)
   \( DE \) is half of the diagonal of the square base, so \( DE = \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

   Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle \( ADE \):
   \( AD^2 = AE^2 + DE^2 \)
   \( AD^2 = s^2 + \left(\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 \)
   \( AD^2 = s^2 + \frac{s^2}{2} \)
   \( AD^2 = \frac{3s^2}{2} \)
   \( AD = s\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \)

2. **Use the properties of right triangle \( ABD \) to determine \( \angle ABD \)**:
   In right triangle \( ABD \), \( AD \) is the hypotenuse, \( AB = s \) is one leg, and \( BD \) is the other leg which is the diagonal of the square base: \( BD = s\sqrt{2} \).

   We can use the definition of sine to determine \( \angle ABD \):
   \[ \sin(\angle ABD) = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse} = \frac{AB}{AD} \]
   \[ \sin(\angle ABD) = \frac{s}{s\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}} \]
   \[ \sin(\angle ABD) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \]

   Using the inverse sine function (or arcsine), we get:
   \[ \angle ABD = \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right) \]

Using a calculator, we can determine:
\[ \angle ABD \approx 54.74^\circ \]

Hence, the degree measure of angle \( ABD \) is approximately \( 54.74^\circ \).

Alright, let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Find the radius of each semi-circle.

1.1 The radius of the semi-circle with center \( K \):
\[ AK = \frac{AO + OC}{2} = \frac{68 + 32}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]
So, \( AK = 50 \).

1.2 The radius of the semi-circle with center \( O \):
\[ AO = 68 \]
So, \( AO = 68 \).

1.3 The radius of the semi-circle with center \( M \):
\[ MB = \frac{MC + CB}{2} = \frac{18 + 36}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]
So, \( MB = 27 \).

**Step 2:** Find the area of each semi-circle.

2.1 The area of the semi-circle with center \( K \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times (50^2) = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times 2500 = 1250\pi \]

2.2 The area of the semi-circle with center \( O \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times (68^2) = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times 4624 = 2312\pi \]

2.3 The area of the semi-circle with center \( M \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times (27^2) = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times 729 = 364.5\pi \]

**Step 3:** Find the area of the shaded region.

To find the shaded region, we'll subtract the areas of the smaller semi-circles from the largest one:
\[ 2312\pi - (1250\pi + 364.5\pi) = 2312\pi - 1614.5\pi = 697.5\pi \]

Thus, the area of the shaded region is \( 697.5\pi \) square units.

Alright, let's find the area of the circle step by step.

**Step 1:** Find the radius of the circle.
The radius can be found by calculating the distance between the center of the circle $C(3,1)$ and any point on the circle. In this case, we can use the point $(8,1)$.

Using the distance formula, which is:
\[ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]
where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.

For our points, $C(3,1)$ and $(8,1)$:
\[ d = \sqrt{(8 - 3)^2 + (1 - 1)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{5^2 + 0^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{25} \]
\[ d = 5 \]

So, the radius of the circle, $r$, is 5 units.

**Step 2:** Calculate the area of the circle.
The area, $A$, of a circle with radius $r$ is given by:
\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

Plugging in our radius:
\[ A = \pi (5^2) \]
\[ A = \pi (25) \]
\[ A = 25\pi \]

So, the area of the circle in terms of $\pi$ is \( 25\pi \) square units.
