To find the area of triangle ABC, we first need to understand the relationships between the areas of similar triangles and the lengths of their sides, and also how the midpoints of a triangle form another triangle inside it.

Given:
1. Triangle ABC is right-angled at C.
2. M, N, and P are the midpoints of sides BC, AC, and AB, respectively.
3. The area of triangle APN is 2 cm².

We need to find the area of triangle ABC.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to solve this problem:

Step 1: Understand the properties of midpoints in triangles.
- When you connect the midpoints of two sides of a triangle, you create a segment that is parallel to and half the length of the third side.
- Triangle APN is similar to triangle ABC because all corresponding angles are equal. Specifically, the line segment NP is parallel to BC, and AP is parallel to AC. This is a consequence of the midpoint theorem.

Step 2: Use the properties of similar triangles.
- The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding lengths.
- Since M, N, and P are midpoints, NP is half the length of BC, and AP is half the length of AC. The same goes for PM and AB. Therefore, each side of triangle APN is half the length of the corresponding side of triangle ABC.

Step 3: Set up the ratio of the areas of triangles APN and ABC.
- Let's denote the area of triangle ABC as K cm².
- Since the sides of triangle APN are half the length of the sides of triangle ABC, the area of triangle APN is (1/2)² = 1/4 of the area of triangle ABC.

So, we have:
Area of APN = (1/4) * Area of ABC

Step 4: Use the given area of triangle APN to find the area of triangle ABC.
- We know the area of triangle APN is 2 cm².
- So, 2 = (1/4) * K
- To find K, we need to solve the equation. Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate K:
  K = 4 * 2 = 8

Step 5: Conclude the solution.
- The area of triangle ABC is 8 cm². 

Thus, the area of triangle ABC is 8 square centimeters.

The diagram shows a sector of a circle with a central angle of 60 degrees and a radius of 12. To find the perimeter of this sector, we need to calculate the length of the two radii (which are both straight lines from point O to points A and B, respectively) and the length of the arc (the curved line from point A to point B).

1. Calculate the lengths of the two radii:
Since both OA and OB are radii of the circle, and it's given that the radius of the circle is 12, the length of each radius is 12 units.

2. Calculate the length of the arc AB:
The length of an arc (s) can be calculated using the formula: s = r * θ, where r is the radius of the circle, and θ is the central angle in radians. Since the central angle in this sector is given in degrees (60 degrees), we need to convert it to radians first. The conversion formula is: radians = degrees * (π/180).

Let's calculate θ in radians:

θ = 60 * (π/180)
  = π/3 radians.

Now, we can find the length of the arc AB:

s = r * θ
  = 12 * (π/3)
  = 4π.

3. Calculate the perimeter of the sector:
The perimeter of the sector is the sum of the lengths of the two radii and the length of the arc:

Perimeter = OA + OB + AB
          = 12 + 12 + 4π
          = 24 + 4π.

So, the perimeter of the sector of the circle is 24 + 4π units.

To find the area of the triangle formed by the lines $y = -2x + 8$, $y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2$, and $x = -2$, we'll first need to determine the points where these lines intersect each other, which will be the vertices of the triangle. We already know one of the points is $(4,0)$. 

1. **Intersection of $y = -2x + 8$ and $x = -2$:**
   Substituting $x = -2$ into the equation $y = -2x + 8$, we have:
   \(y = -2(-2) + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12\).
   So, one point of intersection is \((-2,12)\).

2. **Intersection of $y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2$ and $x = -2$:**
   Substituting $x = -2$ into the equation $y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2$, we get:
   \(y = \frac{1}{2}(-2) - 2 = -1 - 2 = -3\).
   So, the second point of intersection is \((-2,-3)\).

Now we have the three vertices of the triangle: $(4,0)$, $(-2,12)$, and $(-2,-3)$. 

To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices, which is derived from the determinant of a matrix:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|.
\]

However, noticing that the triangle has a right angle (the lines $y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2$ and $x = -2$ are perpendicular), we can instead use the simpler formula for the area of a right triangle, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\). 

Here, the "base" of the triangle can be considered as the horizontal distance between the points $(4,0)$ and $(-2,-3)$ (which is the same as the distance to $(-2,12)$ since they have the same $x$-coordinate). The "height" of the triangle is the vertical distance between the points $(-2,12)$ and $(-2,-3)$.

- **Calculating the base:**
  The base is the difference in the x-coordinates of $(4,0)$ and $(-2,-3)$.
  Base = $4 - (-2) = 4 + 2 = 6$.

- **Calculating the height:**
  The height is the difference in the y-coordinates of $(-2,12)$ and $(-2,-3)$.
  Height = $12 - (-3) = 12 + 3 = 15$.

Now, we can calculate the area:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 15 = 3 \times 15 = 45.
\]

So, the area of the triangle is \(45\) square units.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Known Angles**: 
   - In square $ABCD$, all angles are right angles, i.e., each is $90^\circ$ because that's a property of squares.
   - In equilateral triangle $AED$, all angles are equal, and because the sum of angles in any triangle is $180^\circ$, each angle in an equilateral triangle is $180^\circ / 3 = 60^\circ$. This is a property of equilateral triangles.

2. **Analyze the Target Angle $BAE$**:
   - Angle $BAE$ is part of a larger angle, $DAE$, which is an angle of the equilateral triangle, so it measures $60^\circ$.
   - The other part of angle $DAE$ is angle $DAB$, which is a right angle because $ABCD$ is a square. So, angle $DAB$ is $90^\circ$.

3. **Use Angle Addition Postulate**:
   - The Angle Addition Postulate states that if you place two angles side by side, the measure of the resulting angle will be equal to the sum of the measures of the two original angles. 
   - Here, we know angle $DAE$ ($60^\circ$) is the sum of angle $DAB$ ($90^\circ$) and angle $BAE$ (unknown). 

4. **Solve for the Unknown**:
   - Now, we'll set up an equation using the Angle Addition Postulate and solve for angle $BAE$:
     \[
     DAB + BAE = DAE
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     90^\circ + BAE = 60^\circ
     \]
   - Solving for $BAE$ gives:
     \[
     BAE = 60^\circ - 90^\circ
     \]
     \[
     BAE = -30^\circ
     \]
   - However, a negative angle doesn't make sense in this geometrical context. We made a mistake in our understanding. Angle $BAE$ actually forms part of angle $BAD$, not $DAE$. So the equation should be:
     \[
     BAE + DAB = BAD
     \]
     And since $BAD$ is part of the square, it's a right angle, or $90^\circ$. So:
     \[
     BAE + 90^\circ = 90^\circ
     \]
   - Solving for $BAE$ gives:
     \[
     BAE = 90^\circ - 90^\circ
     \]
     \[
     BAE = 0^\circ
     \]
   - However, an angle of $0^\circ$ doesn't make sense either because there clearly is some angle between lines $AB$ and $AE$. We realize our mistake: angle $BAD$ isn't just $90^\circ$; it's actually $90^\circ + 60^\circ = 150^\circ$ because it includes angle $DAE$ from the equilateral triangle.

5. **Correct the Equation and Solve Again**:
   - Correcting our equation for $BAD$ being $150^\circ$:
     \[
     BAE + 90^\circ = 150^\circ
     \]
   - Solving for $BAE$ gives:
     \[
     BAE = 150^\circ - 90^\circ
     \]
     \[
     BAE = 60^\circ
     \]

Thus, the measure of angle $BAE$ is $60^\circ$.

To solve for the area of triangle \(CDE\), we need to understand the properties of similar triangles and their areas, especially since lines \(AB\) and \(DE\) are given as parallel.

1. **Identify Similar Triangles:** 
   Since \(\overline{AB}\) is parallel to \(\overline{DE}\), and both are intersected by line segment \(\overline{BD}\), we know by the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem that \(\angle ABD = \angle EBD\) and \(\angle BDA = \angle BDE\). This means that \(\triangle ABD \sim \triangle EBD\) (they are similar) because they have the same angle measures.

2. **Understand Proportions of Similar Triangles:**
   When two triangles are similar, the lengths of corresponding sides are proportional. The ratio of any two corresponding sides in the similar triangles is called the scale factor. If one triangle has sides that are \(k\) times the length of the sides of another, the area of the first triangle is \(k^2\) times the area of the second. Here, we know that \(BD = 4BC\), so the scale factor \(k\) between \(\triangle BCD\) and \(\triangle BDE\) is 4.

3. **Calculate the Area of the Larger Triangle:**
   Given that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 6 square centimeters, and knowing that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle BCD\) share the base \(\overline{BC}\), they thus have the same height if considered from this base. Hence, their areas are in the ratio of their bases, which is 1:4 (since \(BD = 4BC\)). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle BCD\) is \(\frac{1}{4}\) that of \(\triangle ABC\), i.e., \(\frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5\) square centimeters.

4. **Use the Scale Factor for Areas:**
   Now, we know \(\triangle BCD\) and \(\triangle BDE\) are similar with a scale factor of 4 (in length), meaning the scale factor for the areas is \(k^2 = 4^2 = 16\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle BDE\) is \(16\) times the area of \(\triangle BCD\), because the area is proportional to the square of the side lengths. So, the area of \(\triangle CDE = 16 \times 1.5 = 24\) square centimeters.

So, the area of \(\triangle CDE\) is **24 square centimeters**.

To find the ratio of the areas of the smallest and largest regions, we first need to identify these regions and then calculate their areas. The shapes are irregular, so we might not be able to apply standard area formulas directly. Instead, we'll need to use geometric properties and potentially break the shapes down into smaller, more manageable components.

Step 1: Identify the smallest and largest regions.
- By visual inspection, the smallest region seems to be one of the triangles at the vertices of the hexagon, such as the triangle formed by points (0,0), (1,0), and the midpoint on the line joining (0,0) and (1,1).
- The largest region appears to be the central one, bounded by the midpoints of all the sides of the hexagon.

Step 2: Calculate the area of the smallest region.
- The area of a triangle is 0.5 * base * height. The base of the smallest triangle is the distance between (0,0) and (1,0), which is 1 unit. 
- The height is a bit trickier because the triangle is not right-angled. However, we notice that the line joining (0,0) and (1,1) is part of a larger equilateral triangle formed by points (0,0), (2,2), and (1,1). The side length of this equilateral triangle is the distance between (0,0) and (2,2), which can be calculated using the distance formula: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = sqrt(8). 
- The height of an equilateral triangle is (sqrt(3)/2) * side. So, the height here is (sqrt(3)/2) * sqrt(8) = sqrt(6). But we want the height of the smaller triangle, which is half the height of the equilateral triangle, so it's sqrt(6)/2.
- The area of the smallest triangle is 0.5 * 1 * sqrt(6)/2 = sqrt(6)/4.

Step 3: Calculate the area of the largest region.
- The largest region is a hexagon, and it appears to be regular (all sides and angles equal) because it's symmetrical and centrally located. However, calculating the area directly could be complicated.
- A strategy here is to notice that the original large hexagon is composed of 6 smaller equilateral triangles, each with a vertex at the center of the hexagon. The largest region takes up one of these triangles entirely and half of each of the surrounding 6 triangles. So, in total, it's equivalent to the area of 4 of these smaller equilateral triangles.
- We've already calculated that the side length of one of these smaller triangles is sqrt(8), and its height is sqrt(6). The area of one triangle is 0.5 * sqrt(8) * sqrt(6) = sqrt(48)/2 = sqrt(12).
- So, the area of the largest region is 4 * sqrt(12) = 4sqrt(12).

Step 4: Find the ratio of the smallest to the largest area.
- The ratio is (sqrt(6)/4) : 4sqrt(12) = sqrt(6)/4 / 4sqrt(12) = sqrt(6) / 16sqrt(12) = sqrt(6)/sqrt(144) = sqrt(6)/12.
- Simplifying the ratio, we get 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2 (multiplying by sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) to rationalize the denominator).

So, the ratio of the areas of the smallest region to the largest region is sqrt(2):2.

To solve this problem, we'll use a combination of geometric properties, including the properties of isosceles right triangles, the formula for the area of a circle, and the Pythagorean theorem.

1. Understanding the figure:
- Triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle, which means angles ACB and BCA are both 45 degrees, and angle ABC is 90 degrees.
- The semicircle is tangent to sides AC and BC, and its center O is on the hypotenuse AB.
- Since the semicircle is tangent to both sides of the triangle, and the triangle is isosceles, the radius of the semicircle is equal to half the length of side AC or BC.

2. Find the radius of the semicircle:
The area of the semicircle is given as 2π. The area of a full circle is πr^2, so the area of a semicircle is 1/2 * πr^2. Thus,

1/2 * πr^2 = 2π,
πr^2 = 4π,
r^2 = 4,
r = 2.

The radius of the semicircle is 2 units.

3. Relate the radius to the triangle's sides:
Because the semicircle's radius is also half the length of side AC (or BC), the full length of AC (and BC, because it's isosceles) is 4 units.

4. Determine the hypotenuse's length:
In an isosceles right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of each leg (this is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem: if the legs are "a" and "a", the hypotenuse is √(a^2 + a^2) = a√2). So, the length of the hypotenuse AB is:

AB = 4√2.

5. Calculate the triangle's area:
The area of a right triangle is 1/2 * base * height. Here, the base and the height are the same, since it's an isosceles right triangle. Each is 4 units. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is:

Area = 1/2 * base * height,
Area = 1/2 * 4 * 4,
Area = 8.

So, the area of triangle ABC is 8 square units.

Given that a right circular cone is inscribed in a right circular cylinder, we know that both shapes share the same height and the diameter of the base of the cone is equal to the diameter of the base of the cylinder.

First, let's find the dimensions of the cylinder. We know the volume of the cylinder is given by:

\[V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r_{\text{cylinder}}^2 h_{\text{cylinder}} = 72\pi \text{ cubic centimeters}\]

However, we don't know the individual values of \(r_{\text{cylinder}}\) (radius of the cylinder's base) and \(h_{\text{cylinder}}\) (height of the cylinder). 

But we do know that the cylinder and the cone share the same height and the same base radius because the cone is inscribed in the cylinder. This means:

\[r_{\text{cylinder}} = r_{\text{cone}}\]
\[h_{\text{cylinder}} = h_{\text{cone}}\]

Next, we know the formula for the volume of a cone is:

\[V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r_{\text{cone}}^2 h_{\text{cone}}\]

Since the cone is inscribed in the cylinder, the volume of the cone will be one-third of the volume of the cylinder if they both have the same height and radius (which they do in this case), because of the \(\frac{1}{3}\) in the formula for the volume of a cone.

So, we can find the volume of the cone as:

\[V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} V_{\text{cylinder}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 72\pi = 24\pi \text{ cubic centimeters}\]

The space inside the cylinder but outside the cone will be the difference between the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the cone:

\[\text{Space} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - V_{\text{cone}} = 72\pi - 24\pi = 48\pi \text{ cubic centimeters}\]

So, the number of cubic centimeters in the space inside the cylinder but outside the cone is \(48\pi\).

Given the information and the diagram, we understand that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AC = BC, and point X is such that AC = CX. Also, from the diagram, angle B is given as 30 degrees. We are tasked with finding the measure of angle AXC.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:

1. **Identify known angles and sides:**
   - In triangle ABC, angle B is 30 degrees.
   - Because ABC is an isosceles triangle with AC = BC, angles CAB and CBA are congruent. 
   - We also know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

2. **Calculate angle CAB (or CBA) in triangle ABC:**
   - Since the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, and we know angle B is 30 degrees, the sum of angles CAB and CBA is 180 - 30 = 150 degrees.
   - Given that angles CAB and CBA are equal (because AC = BC), each one is half of 150 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle CAB = angle CBA = 150/2 = 75 degrees.

3. **Analyze triangle ACX:**
   - AC = CX (given), which means triangle ACX is also an isosceles triangle.
   - Because it's an isosceles triangle, angles CAX and CAX are congruent.

4. **Calculate angle CAX (or CXA) in triangle ACX:**
   - We already know angle CAB is 75 degrees.
   - Angle CAX is adjacent to angle CAB and together they form a straight line from points X to B. Therefore, they add up to 180 degrees (as a straight angle).
   - Angle CAX = 180 - angle CAB = 180 - 75 = 105 degrees (also, angle CXA = 105 degrees since CAX = CXA).

5. **Calculate angle AXC in triangle ACX:**
   - Again, using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can find angle AXC by subtracting the other two angles from 180.
   - Angle AXC = 180 - (angle CAX + angle CXA) = 180 - (105 + 105) = 180 - 210 = -30 degrees.

However, an angle measure cannot be negative, which indicates that there's a contradiction in our initial assumptions or given data. Upon reviewing the information, it seems there's an issue with the original diagram:

- If angle B is 30 degrees in an isosceles triangle ABC with sides AC = BC, then angles CBA and CAB would both be 75 degrees, as calculated. However, extending line BC to a point X such that CX = AC would not form an angle AXC that's part of a valid triangle, given these measurements.

In a real-world context, this scenario can't exist—there's an inconsistency in the given information. If all the other information were accurate (e.g., lengths of sides and the 30-degree angle), point X wouldn't align in such a way to create a triangle with the described properties. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the measure of angle AXC based on the provided information, as it involves an unrealistic geometric configuration.

To find the area of the parallelogram UVRW, we need to understand the properties of the figures given and use them to our advantage. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Understand the properties of the triangles and the midpoints:
   - Both triangles PQR and STU are given to have an area of 1.
   - Points U, W, and V are midpoints of the sides of triangle PQR.
   - Points R, V, and W are midpoints of the sides of triangle STU.
   - Because U, V, and W are midpoints, the line segments connecting these points are parallel to the bases of the triangles they are connected to. This is due to the properties of a triangle's midsegment, which states that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

2. Analyze the formation of parallelogram UVRW:
   - UVRW is a parallelogram because both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. UV is parallel to RW because both are half the length of and parallel to ST, and UW is parallel to VR because both are half the length of and parallel to PQ and TR, respectively.

3. Find the area of parallelogram UVRW:
   - One way to find the area of a parallelogram is to use the base times the height (A = bh). However, we don't have explicit numbers for these dimensions.
   - Instead, we can use the properties of the triangles and parallelogram to our advantage. Since U, V, and W are midpoints, the segments UW, VW, and UV each split the triangles into smaller triangles with equal areas. Because each larger triangle has an area of 1, each smaller triangle has an area of 1/2.
   - Parallelogram UVRW consists of two of these smaller triangles from each larger triangle. From triangle STU, it includes triangles URW and VRW. From triangle PQR, it includes triangles UQV and VWQ.
   - Because each of these smaller triangles has an area of 1/2, and there are two from each larger triangle in the parallelogram, the total area of parallelogram UVRW is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

So, the area of parallelogram UVRW is 1.

To find the area of the quadrilateral DYES, we need to approach this step by step, understanding the properties of the shapes involved and using basic geometry concepts such as Pythagoras theorem, properties of similar triangles, and properties of squares.

1. **Identifying known quantities:**
   - We know that ABDC, EFHG, and ASHY are squares.
   - We're given that AB = EF = 1 and AY = 5.

2. **Finding lengths of segments:**
   Since AY is the diagonal of the square ASHY and its length is 5, we can find the side of the square using the properties of a 45-45-90 right triangle (half of the square) where the sides are in the ratio 1:1:√2. 
   - Let's denote the side of the square ASHY as x. Then, we have:
     x^2 + x^2 = 5^2 (because AY is the hypotenuse of the isosceles right triangle formed by two x sides)
   - Solving for x gives:
     2x^2 = 25
     x^2 = 12.5
     x = √12.5

3. **Identifying similar triangles:**
   - Triangles ADY and ESY are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity because both are right triangles sharing angle DYA (which equals angle EYS since D, A, E, and S are all corners of squares and thus are right angles).
   - The ratio of corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal. So, we have AD/ES = DY/EY.

4. **Calculating lengths using similar triangles:**
   - We know AD = 1 (since it's a side of square ABDC) and DY = x (side of the square ASHY), and EY is DY - DE = x - 1 (because DE is a side of square EFHG and thus equals 1).
   - The similarity ratio then gives 1/ES = x/(x - 1).
   - Solving this equation for ES gives ES = (x - 1)/x.

5. **Finding the area of triangle DYE:**
   - The area of a triangle is 0.5 * base * height. Using DY as the base and ES as the height (since they are perpendicular), the area of triangle DYE is:
     0.5 * x * ((x - 1)/x) = 0.5 * (x - 1)

6. **Finding the area of square ESHF:**
   - The side of square EFHG is given as 1, so the area of square EFHG is 1 * 1 = 1.

7. **Finding the area of triangle EFS:**
   - Triangle EFS is a right triangle, and we can use EF as the base and ES as the height.
   - We've previously calculated ES as (x - 1)/x, and we know EF = 1, so the area of triangle EFS is:
     0.5 * 1 * ((x - 1)/x) = 0.5 * (x - 1)/x

8. **Calculating the area of quadrilateral DYES:**
   - The area of quadrilateral DYES is the total area of square ESHF and triangle DYE minus the area of triangle EFS.
   - Thus, the area is 1 + 0.5 * (x - 1) - 0.5 * (x - 1)/x.

Now, let's substitute x = √12.5 into our equations and find the exact area of the quadrilateral DYES.

   - x = √12.5
   - ES = (√12.5 - 1)/√12.5
   - Area of DYE = 0.5 * (√12.5 - 1)
   - Area of EFS = 0.5 * (√12.5 - 1)/√12.5

   - Area of DYES = 1 + 0.5 * (√12.5 - 1) - 0.5 * (√12.5 - 1)/√12.5

Calculating the exact value will give the area of quadrilateral DYES. After substituting and performing the arithmetic operations, you should be able to find the area value. Remember to simplify the final result for clarity.

The problem involves finding the surface area of a six-sided hollow aluminum container in the shape of a rectangular prism, and then calculating the cost of the aluminum used based on the area. The shape is a rectangular box with dimensions $10''$ (width) x $10''$ (length) x $12''$ (height). The surface area of a rectangular prism is calculated by finding the area of each of the six faces and adding them up.

Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Calculate the area of each face of the prism:**
    - The prism has 6 faces: 2 each with dimensions $10''$ x $10''$, 2 with dimensions $10''$ x $12''$, and 2 with dimensions $12''$ x $10''$.
    - Area of smaller square face: $10'' \times 10'' = 100 \text{ in}^2$ (there are 2 of these).
    - Area of larger rectangle face: $10'' \times 12'' = 120 \text{ in}^2$ (there are 2 of these).
    - The remaining two faces also have an area of $10'' \times 12'' = 120 \text{ in}^2$ each (there are 2 of these).
  
2. **Calculate the total surface area of the prism:**
    - Total surface area = (Area of smaller square faces) + (Area of larger rectangle faces)
    - Total surface area = (2 x 100 \text{ in}^2) + (2 x 120 \text{ in}^2) + (2 x 120 \text{ in}^2)
    - Total surface area = 200 \text{ in}^2 + 240 \text{ in}^2 + 240 \text{ in}^2
    - Total surface area = 680 \text{ in}^2

3. **Calculate the cost of the aluminum used:**
    - The cost of aluminum is given as $0.05 per square inch.
    - Total cost = (Total surface area) x (Cost per square inch)
    - Total cost = 680 \text{ in}^2 x $0.05/\text{in}^2
    - Total cost = $34

So, the cost of the aluminum used to make one container is $34.

To solve for the measure of angle XQS in the given regular pentagon PQRST, where X is the midpoint of ST, we need to follow a systematic approach. We'll use the properties of regular polygons, the concept of an isosceles triangle, and some basic geometry principles.

1. **Understand Properties of Regular Polygons**: A regular pentagon has all its sides equal in length, and all its interior angles are equal. Each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures 108 degrees because the sum of all interior angles in any pentagon is 540 degrees (using the formula (n-2)*180, where n is the number of sides, here 5), and in the case of a regular pentagon, all five angles are equal, so each is 540/5 = 108 degrees.

2. **Identify Relevant Triangles**: Segment ST is bisected at point X. Since a pentagon's sides are all equal, it means that segments SX and XT are equal. Notice that triangles QXT and QSX are isosceles triangles because two sides are equal (QT = QS and SX = XT).

3. **Angles in Isosceles Triangle**: In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. Therefore, in triangle QXT, angles QXT and QTX are equal. Similarly, in triangle QSX, angles QXS and QSX are equal.

4. **Exterior Angle**: Angle QST is an exterior angle for triangle QXT, and the sum of angles QXT and QTX (the remote interior angles) is equal to angle QST. Since QXT = QTX, and QST = 108 degrees (as it's an interior angle of a regular pentagon), each of angles QXT and QTX is 108/2 = 54 degrees.

5. **Find Angles in Triangle QSX**: We know that QXS = QSX and SX = XT. Since we already determined that angle QTX is 54 degrees, angle QXS is also 54 degrees (they are opposite the same length sides). 

6. **Angle Sum in Triangle**: The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. In triangle QSX, we have angles QSX, QXS, and SXQ. We've determined QXS = 54 degrees, and QSX = 54 degrees. So, SXQ = 180 - 54 - 54 = 72 degrees.

7. **Determine Angle XQS**: Finally, we need to find the measure of angle XQS. Angle XQS is an exterior angle to triangle QSX, and it's equal to the sum of the opposite interior angles (QXS and SXQ). Therefore, XQS = QXS + SXQ = 54 + 72 = 126 degrees.

So, the measure of angle XQS is 126 degrees.

To find the ratio of the area of triangle DEF to that of triangle ABE, we need to find the areas of both triangles. The area of a triangle can be calculated if we know the base and the height, or if we know the lengths of all sides, using Heron's formula. However, in this problem, we can use the properties of the square and the equilateral triangle to find a simpler solution.

Step 1: Understand the properties of the shapes involved.
- Square ABCD: All sides are of equal length, and all angles are 90 degrees.
- Triangle BEF: All sides are of equal length (equilateral), and all angles are 60 degrees.

Step 2: Let's denote the side length of square ABCD as "s." Because BEF is an equilateral triangle, and one of its sides is a side of the square, each side of triangle BEF is also "s."

Step 3: The height (altitude) of an equilateral triangle splits it into two 30-60-90 right triangles. Therefore, triangle BDE is a 30-60-90 triangle. We'll use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to determine the lengths we need. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the lengths of the sides opposite the 30°, 60°, and 90° angles is 1:√3:2.

Step 4: Find the length of DE, which is the side opposite the 60° angle in triangle BDE. Because BE is "s" and using the 1:√3:2 ratio, the length of DE (side opposite the 60° angle) will be (s/2)√3.

Step 5: Calculate the areas of the triangles.
- Area of triangle ABE (equilateral): (sqrt(3)/4) * s^2
- Area of triangle DEF (right triangle): We use the formula 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * s * (s/2)√3 = (s^2/4)√3

Step 6: Calculate the ratio of the areas of triangles DEF and ABE.
- (Area of DEF) / (Area of ABE) = [(s^2/4)√3] / [(sqrt(3)/4) * s^2]
- Simplify the above expression by canceling out the common terms. The s^2 terms and the factor of 1/4 in both numerator and denominator will cancel out, leaving us with:
- Ratio = (√3) / (√3) = 1

So, the ratio of the area of triangle DEF to that of triangle ABE is 1:1.

To find the total area of the two non-shaded crescent-shaped regions, we need to calculate the area of each semicircle and then subtract the area of the triangle. 

1. **Calculate the area of each semicircle:** 
The semicircles are constructed along the sides of the triangle, so their diameters are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. The radii of the semicircles are half the length of each side.

    a. For the semicircle along the side with length 6 inches (one of the legs), the radius is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) inches. The area of a circle is \( \pi r^2 \), so the area of this semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (3)^2 = \frac{9}{2} \pi \) square inches.

    b. For the semicircle along the side with length 8 inches (the other leg), the radius is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) inches. The area of this semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (4)^2 = 8 \pi \) square inches.

2. **Calculate the area of the triangle:** 
The area of a right triangle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). Here, the base and height are the legs of the triangle, which are 6 inches and 8 inches respectively. So, the area of the triangle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8 = 24 \) square inches.

3. **Calculate the total area of the crescent-shaped regions:** 
The total area of the semicircles is the sum of the areas of the two semicircles, which is \( \frac{9}{2} \pi + 8 \pi = \frac{25}{2} \pi \) square inches. The crescent-shaped regions are the semicircles minus the area of the triangle, so their total area is \( \frac{25}{2} \pi - 24 \) square inches.

4. **Simplify the expression (if possible):** 
The expression \( \frac{25}{2} \pi - 24 \) is already in its simplest form. So, the total area of the two non-shaded crescent-shaped regions is \( \frac{25}{2} \pi - 24 \) square inches.

The diagram illustrates two triangles with parallel bases. To determine the ratio of the areas of the two triangles, we'll need to use the properties of similar triangles and the formula for the area of a triangle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identifying Similar Triangles:**
   - The diagram appears to show two triangles that are similar (though it's not explicitly stated, it's implied by the nature of the diagram and the question). This means they have the same shape, but not necessarily the same size. The angles of one triangle are congruent to the angles of the other, and the sides are in proportion.
   - Similar triangles are a direct result of one triangle being an exact scale replica of the other.

2. **Recalling Area Formula for Triangles:**
   - The area of a triangle is calculated as: Area = (base * height) / 2.
   - When two triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions (such as heights, bases, or sides).

3. **Observing Given Lengths:**
   - The lengths provided are "4 cm" and "10 cm," which are the bases of the smaller and larger triangles, respectively.

4. **Determining Linear Ratio:**
   - The base of the smaller triangle is 4 cm, and the base of the larger triangle is 10 cm.
   - The ratio of the bases of the two triangles is 4/10. This can be simplified to 2/5 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2.

5. **Applying the Area Ratio for Similar Triangles:**
   - The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions.
   - Therefore, the ratio of the areas is (2/5)^2.

6. **Calculating the Square of the Ratio:**
   - (2/5)^2 = 4/25.

**Conclusion:**
The ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle is 4/25.

The trapezoid OBCD provided is located in the Cartesian coordinate system. We know the coordinates of each vertex, which are:
- O(0,0)
- B(8,0)
- C(4,3)
- D(2,3)

To find the area of the trapezoid, we'll first need to find the lengths of the two bases (parallel sides) and the height (perpendicular distance between the two bases).

1. **Find the Lengths of the Bases:**
   The bases of the trapezoid are the parallel sides, which are OB and CD.

   - Length of OB (base 1): This is the distance between points O(0,0) and B(8,0). Since both points lie on the x-axis (y=0), the length of OB is the difference in x-coordinates, which is 8 - 0 = 8 units.

   - Length of CD (base 2): This is the distance between points C(4,3) and D(2,3). Since both points have the same y-coordinate (meaning they are horizontally aligned), the length is the difference in x-coordinates, which is 4 - 2 = 2 units.

2. **Find the Height:**
   The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between the two bases. Since CD is horizontal (parallel to the x-axis), the height is the difference in the y-coordinates of any one of the points on lines OB and CD. We can use points O and D for this, so the height is the y-coordinate of D minus the y-coordinate of O, which is 3 - 0 = 3 units.

3. **Calculate the Area:**
   The area \(A\) of a trapezoid is given by the formula:

   \[
   A = \frac{(b_1 + b_2) \cdot h}{2}
   \]

   where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are the lengths of the two bases, and \(h\) is the height.

   Substituting the values we found:

   - \(b_1 = 8\) (length of OB)
   - \(b_2 = 2\) (length of CD)
   - \(h = 3\) (height)

   into the formula gives:

   \[
   A = \frac{(8 + 2) \cdot 3}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ square units}
   \]

   So, the area of trapezoid OBCD is 15 square units.

To find the area of triangle OBC, we need to know its base and height, or alternatively, the lengths of all sides to apply Heron's formula. Let's analyze the information and the figure step by step:

1. **Recognizing the triangle type**: Triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle because AB = AC. 

2. **Finding the circumcenter**: The circumcenter O of an isosceles triangle lies on the perpendicular bisector of the base (BC in this case), which also happens to be the altitude, the median, and the angle bisector from the apex angle (angle A). So, O is on the line segment from A perpendicular to BC.

3. **Identifying radius of the circumcircle**: O, as the circumcenter, is equidistant from A, B, and C. This common distance is the radius of the circumcircle. Since triangle ABC is isosceles, the altitude from A to BC (where O lies) also bisects BC. Therefore, the foot of the altitude from A (which we'll call point D) divides BC into two segments, BD and DC, each of length 6/2 = 3. The radius of the circumcircle, OD, is also the length of the line segments OA, OB, and OC.

4. **Calculating the circumradius (OD)**: To find OD, we can first find AD using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD (or ADC since AB = AC, and BD = DC):

   AD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2
   AD^2 + 3^2 = 5^2
   AD^2 + 9 = 25
   AD^2 = 16
   AD = 4

   Now, triangle AOD is a right triangle (because AD is an altitude), so we can again use the Pythagorean theorem to find OD (the circumradius):

   AD^2 + OD^2 = AO^2
   4^2 + OD^2 = 5^2
   16 + OD^2 = 25
   OD^2 = 9
   OD = 3

5. **Finding the area of triangle OBC**: Now, we know that OD = OB = OC = 3 (since O is the circumcenter). Triangle OBC is also isosceles (since OB = OC). We need the height from O to BC (which we'll call h) to compute the area. Since triangle OBD is a right triangle (OD is perpendicular to BC because it's on the altitude from A), we can use it to find h:

   OD^2 = BD^2 + h^2
   3^2 = 3^2 + h^2
   9 = 9 + h^2
   h^2 = 0
   h = 0

   The area of triangle OBC is then:

   Area = 0.5 * BC * h
   Area = 0.5 * 6 * 0
   Area = 0

   So, surprisingly, the area of triangle OBC is 0, because point O actually lies on BC, making triangle OBC a degenerate triangle with no area.
@@
In the given triangle, angles A and B are equal. Therefore, it is an isosceles triangle, because it has two equal angles. According to the properties of an isosceles triangle, the sides opposite the equal angles are also equal. This means that the sides AC and BC are equal in length. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the type of triangle: The triangle is isosceles since $\angle A = \angle B$.

2. Equal sides in an isosceles triangle: In an isosceles triangle, the sides opposite the equal angles are also equal. Thus, side AC = side BC.

3. Express the equality of sides AC and BC using given expressions: The length of side AC is given as $3x - 1$ and the length of side BC is given as $2x + 2$. Since AC = BC, we can set up the equation $3x - 1 = 2x + 2$.

4. Solve the equation for x:
   - Subtract $2x$ from both sides to get $x - 1 = 2$.
   - Add 1 to both sides to solve for x, giving $x = 3$.

So, the value of $x$ that satisfies the conditions of this isosceles triangle is $x = 3$.

Let's tackle this geometry problem step by step.

1. Understanding the Setup:
- We have a central circle of radius 2.
- There are four circles each with a radius of 1, externally tangent to the central circle.
- These circles are also tangent to two sides of a square, but the sides of the square are not explicitly drawn. We understand that these are the lines connecting the external circles.
- The goal is to find the area of this square.

2. Visualizing the Square:
- The centers of the four external circles will be the vertices of the square. This is because the circles are tangent to two sides of the square and one another.
- The side length of the square is the distance between the centers of two adjacent circles.

3. Calculating the Side of the Square:
- The centers of two adjacent circles form a straight line that passes through the center of the larger circle.
- The distance from the center of the larger circle to the center of one of the smaller circles is the sum of the radii, which is 2 (radius of larger circle) + 1 (radius of smaller circle) = 3.
- The distance between the centers of two adjacent smaller circles (i.e., the side of the square) is twice this amount (as the line segment connecting these centers goes through the larger circle's center, making the distance double the radius of the larger circle plus the radius of a smaller circle). Therefore, the side of the square is 2 * 3 = 6.

4. Calculating the Area of the Square:
- The area of a square is given by the side length squared.
- With a side length of 6, the area is 6^2 = 36.

So, the area of the square is 36 square units.

The problem involves finding the area of the region that is common to two equilateral triangles formed by joining alternate vertices of a regular hexagon. To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Shape**: We have a regular hexagon, meaning all its sides and angles are equal. By connecting alternate vertices, we've formed two overlapping equilateral triangles (all sides and all angles are equal, and each angle is 60 degrees). The side of each equilateral triangle is given as 4 inches, which is also the side of the hexagon.

2. **Identifying the Common Region**: The region common to the two equilateral triangles is a smaller, upside-down equilateral triangle at the center of the hexagon. This is because the lines forming the larger triangles intersect at the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon, forming the smaller triangle.

3. **Finding the Length of the Sides of the Smaller Triangle**: The smaller central triangle's vertices are the midpoints of the larger triangles' sides. Since the larger triangles' sides are 4 inches, each side of the smaller triangle is 2 inches (half the length of the larger triangle's side).

4. **Calculating the Area of the Smaller Triangle**: We'll use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is (side^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4, where "side" represents the length of a side of the equilateral triangle.

   - Substituting 2 inches for the side, the area A is: 
     A = (2^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4
     A = (4 * sqrt(3)) / 4
     A = sqrt(3) square inches

So, the area of the region that is common to the two triangles, in simplest radical form, is sqrt(3) square inches.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the circumference of the circle on Earth that passes through Lena, Wisconsin, which is at a latitude of $45^\circ$ N. Given that Earth is assumed to be a perfect sphere with an equatorial circumference of 25,100 miles, we need to find the circumference at a latitude 45 degrees north of the equator.

1. **Understanding the Geometry of the Sphere:**
   - First, understand that any circle drawn around the Earth parallel to the equator is called a circle of latitude or a parallel. The equator is the largest possible circle of latitude, and others get progressively smaller as they approach the poles.
   - The location of Lena, Wisconsin, at $45^\circ$ N latitude, is exactly halfway between the equator and the North Pole on the sphere. This means we're dealing with the circumference of a circle of latitude 45 degrees from the equator.

2. **Relating the Circles’ Radii:**
   - The circle through Lena is a smaller circle inside the Earth's sphere, and its center is on the axis of the Earth, not at the Earth's center.
   - The radius of this smaller circle, or the circle's distance from the Earth’s axis to a point on the latitude (like Lena), is less than the Earth's radius. Specifically, it is the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle formed by the Earth's radius, the line from the Earth's center to a point on the latitude circle (hypotenuse), and the line from that point to the Earth's axis (adjacent).
   - Since Lena is at $45^\circ$ latitude, the radius of our circle of interest is the same as the length of the line from the Earth's axis to the surface of the Earth at this latitude. This line is the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle with an angle of $45^\circ$ at the Earth's center, and hypotenuse equal to the Earth's radius. So, the radius of our circle is the Earth's radius times cos($45^\circ$).

3. **Calculating the Earth's Radius:**
   - The circumference of the Earth is given as 25,100 miles. The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. We will reverse-engineer this to find the Earth’s radius.
     - r = C / (2π) = 25,100 / (2π) = 25,100 / 6.28318530718 ≈ 3,994.18 miles

4. **Finding the Radius of the Circle through Lena:**
   - Now, we'll use the relationship between the radii as determined earlier. The radius of the circle at Lena's latitude is the Earth's radius times cos($45^\circ$). Since the cosine of 45 degrees is 1/√2 or √2/2, we have:
     - r_Lena = r_Earth * cos($45^\circ$) = 3,994.18 * (√2/2) ≈ 3,994.18 * 0.7071 ≈ 2,824.50 miles

5. **Calculating the Circumference through Lena:**
   - Now, we calculate the circumference of the circle through Lena using Lena's circle radius.
     - C_Lena = 2π * r_Lena = 2 * π * 2,824.50 ≈ 2 * 3.14159265359 * 2,824.50 ≈ 17,738.62 miles

6. **Rounding to the Nearest Hundred:**
   - Finally, we'll round this result to the nearest hundred miles, as instructed.
     - C_Lena ≈ 17,700 miles (after rounding)

Therefore, the circumference of the circle on Earth parallel to the equator and passing through Lena, Wisconsin, is approximately 17,700 miles to the nearest hundred miles.

To determine the perimeter of the trapezoid, we need to find the lengths of all four sides. We already know two of them: one base is \(16 \text{ cm}\) and the height is \(12 \text{ cm}\). We're missing the lengths of the other base and the non-parallel side (the slanted side or leg).

First, let's find the length of the unknown base using the area formula for a trapezoid. The area \(A\) of a trapezoid can be calculated as:

\[
A = \frac{(a + b) \cdot h}{2}
\]

where:
- \(A\) is the area,
- \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two bases, and
- \(h\) is the height.

We know the area \(A = 162 \text{ cm}^2\), the height \(h = 12 \text{ cm}\), and one of the bases \(a = 16 \text{ cm}\). We can rearrange the formula to solve for the other base \(b\):

\[
162 = \frac{(16 + b) \cdot 12}{2}
\]

Let's solve for \(b\):

1. Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

\[
2 \cdot 162 = (16 + b) \cdot 12
\]

\[
324 = (16 + b) \cdot 12
\]

2. Now, divide both sides by 12:

\[
\frac{324}{12} = 16 + b
\]

\[
27 = 16 + b
\]

3. Subtract 16 from both sides to solve for \(b\):

\[
27 - 16 = b
\]

\[
b = 11
\]

So, the length of the other base of the trapezoid is \(11 \text{ cm}\).

Next, we need to find the lengths of the non-parallel sides (the legs) of the trapezoid. For this, we'll need to use the Pythagorean theorem, but first, we need to find the lengths of the horizontal and vertical components of these slanted sides.

By drawing a line perpendicular from the upper base to the lower base, we divide one of the non-parallel sides into a right triangle. The height of the trapezoid gives the length of the vertical side of this right triangle, which is \(12 \text{ cm}\), and the difference between the lengths of the two bases gives the length of the horizontal side. This horizontal component is \(16 \text{ cm} - 11 \text{ cm} = 5 \text{ cm}\).

The Pythagorean theorem tells us that in a right triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and hypotenuse \(c\),

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

We can apply this theorem to find the length of the slanted side (leg) \(c\):

\[
5^2 + 12^2 = c^2
\]

\[
25 + 144 = c^2
\]

\[
169 = c^2
\]

\[
c = \sqrt{169} = 13
\]

Both non-parallel sides (legs) are congruent in a trapezoid, so they are both \(13 \text{ cm}\) each.

Now, we can find the perimeter \(P\) by adding up the lengths of all the sides:

\[
P = a + b + \text{leg}_1 + \text{leg}_2
\]

\[
P = 16 + 11 + 13 + 13
\]

\[
P = 53
\]

So, the perimeter of the trapezoid is \(53 \text{ cm}\).

To solve this problem, we'll use the properties of similar triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem. Here's how:

1. **Identify Properties of the Triangles**: Both triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, isosceles right triangles. This means they have the same dimensions, and each has a right angle and two equal acute angles. Thus, any figure inscribed within them, maintaining the same positions relative to the triangle's sides, will be congruent.

2. **Understand the Inscribed Square**: The square inscribed in triangle ABC touches the triangle at the midpoint of hypotenuse BC and the right-angled vertex A. Because triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, the square in triangle DEF will be positioned similarly and have the same dimensions as the square in triangle ABC.

3. **Find the Length of the Side of the Square in Triangle ABC**: The area of the inscribed square in triangle ABC is given as 15 square centimeters. Let's denote the side length of this square as 's.' The area of a square is calculated as side length squared, so:

   \(s^2 = 15\)

   To find 's,' we take the square root of both sides:

   \(s = \sqrt{15}\)

4. **Apply Congruence to the Square in Triangle DEF**: Because the triangles are congruent and the squares are positioned similarly in both, the side length of the square inscribed in triangle DEF is also \(\sqrt{15}\) cm.

5. **Calculate the Area of the Square in Triangle DEF**: The area of the square is found by squaring the side length. Since the side length is \(\sqrt{15}\) cm, the area 'A' will be:

   \(A = s^2 = (\sqrt{15})^2 = 15\) square centimeters.

So, the area of the square inscribed in triangle DEF is also 15 square centimeters. Since the question asks for the answer as a common fraction, 15 can be expressed as \(\frac{15}{1}\), so the area is \(\frac{15}{1}\) square centimeters.

The problem is asking for the maximum amount of rope that can be saved by replacing two ropes (HC and HD) with a single rope (HP), where point P is somewhere on the line segment between C and D. This essentially involves finding the point P on the line segment CD such that the length of HP is minimized, since the lesser the length of HP, the more the length of rope saved.

Step 1: Understand the geometric relationships.
The points A, B, C, D, and O form a rectangle on the ground, with O at the center. H is directly above O, forming a vertical line. The lines HA, HB, HC, and HD are the ropes from the balloon to the ground. We know HC is 150m and HD is 130m, and we want to replace HC and HD with a single rope HP.

Step 2: Establish variables and known values.
Let's denote the length of HP as L_HP. The total length of rope saved will be (150 + 130 - L_HP). We're asked to maximize this saved length, which is equivalent to minimizing L_HP.

Since we know the distance between C and D is 140m, and O is the midpoint of line segment CD, OD = OC = 70m.

Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the balloon.
We can use triangle HOD to find the height of the balloon. HOD is a right triangle (as H is directly above O), so we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
HD^2 = OD^2 + OH^2
130^2 = 70^2 + OH^2
OH^2 = 130^2 - 70^2

Calculate OH^2:
OH^2 = 16900 - 4900 = 12000
OH = sqrt(12000) = 109.54m (approximately)

The height of the balloon, OH, is roughly 109.54m.

Step 4: Find the expression for L_HP.
Point P lies on line segment CD. Let's say OP = x. Therefore, PD = 70 - x and PC = 70 + x.

Triangle HPD is a right triangle (as H is directly above O and P is on the ground), so we can again use the Pythagorean theorem:
L_HP^2 = HP^2 = PD^2 + OH^2 = (70 - x)^2 + 109.54^2

Step 5: Minimize L_HP.
To minimize L_HP, we need to minimize L_HP^2, which is a function of x: f(x) = (70 - x)^2 + 109.54^2. This is a quadratic function, and its graph is a parabola opening upwards, meaning it has a minimum value.

The minimum occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which, for a quadratic function in the standard form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, is at x = -b/(2a).

In our function, f(x) = (70 - x)^2 + 109.54^2 = x^2 - 140x + 70^2 + 109.54^2, we have:
a = 1
b = -140
c = 70^2 + 109.54^2

The x-coordinate of the vertex is x = -b/(2a) = 140/2 = 70.

Step 6: Calculate the minimum L_HP.
Substitute x = 70 back into the function to find the minimum L_HP^2 and then find L_HP:
L_HP^2 = (70 - 70)^2 + 109.54^2 = 0 + 109.54^2 = 12000
L_HP = sqrt(12000) = 109.54m

Step 7: Calculate the maximum length of rope saved.
The length of rope saved is the original lengths (150m and 130m) minus the new length:
Saved length = (150 + 130) - L_HP = 280 - 109.54 = 170.46m

The greatest length of rope that can be saved is approximately 170.46 meters.

To find the area of the shaded region in the given triangle, we'll need to understand the properties and relationships between the various segments and points, then use these to calculate areas.

1. **Triangle XYZ and its Area:**
   - Given, the area of triangle XYZ is 8 square inches.

2. **Points A and B:**
   - Points A and B are midpoints of segments XY and XZ, respectively. Because A and B are midpoints, segments XA, AY, XB, and BZ are congruent, and each is half the length of XY and XZ, respectively.

3. **Segment AB:**
   - Because A and B are midpoints, segment AB is parallel to YZ (by the Midpoint Theorem) and half the length of YZ (by the properties of similar triangles).

4. **Altitude XC:**
   - XC is an altitude, meaning it's perpendicular to YZ.
   - XC bisects YZ, meaning YC = CZ.

5. **Triangles XAB and XYZ:**
   - Triangles XAB and XYZ are similar (by AA similarity since we have two pairs of parallel sides, meaning the angles are the same). Additionally, XAB is half the size of XYZ in linear dimensions because its base AB is half the length of the base YZ of XYZ. This means that its area is (1/2)^2 = 1/4 the area of XYZ.

6. **Area of Triangle XAB:**
   - Since the area of triangle XYZ is 8 square inches, the area of triangle XAB, being 1/4 of XYZ, is 1/4 * 8 = 2 square inches.

7. **Triangles XCY, XCZ, and XAB:**
   - Because XC bisects YZ, triangles XCY and XCZ are congruent (by SAS).
   - The area of triangle XCY (or XCZ) is thus half that of XYZ, i.e., 1/2 * 8 = 4 square inches.
   - Also, note that triangle XAB is exactly half of XCY (or XCZ) because both have the same height from point X and their bases AB and YC (or ZC) are in the ratio 1:2. So, the area of triangle XAB is also half of triangle XCY or XCZ, confirming that it's 2 square inches as derived above.

8. **Shaded Region:**
   - The shaded region consists of triangle XAC plus rectangle ACYB.
   - The area of triangle XAC is half that of triangle XAB (they share the same altitude from X, and AC is half of AB because C is the midpoint of YZ). So, the area of triangle XAC is 1/2 * 2 = 1 square inch.
   - Rectangle ACYB has the same base as triangle XAC (i.e., AC) and the same height as triangle XAB (i.e., the altitude from X), so its area is the same as that of triangle XAB, i.e., 2 square inches.

Now, adding the areas of triangle XAC and rectangle ACYB gives the area of the shaded region: 1 + 2 = 3 square inches. So, the area of the shaded region is 3 square inches.

To find the measure of \(\angle AOB\), we'll use the properties of circles, isosceles triangles, and the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Isosceles Triangle:** Given that \(AC = BC\), triangle \(ABC\) is an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. Therefore, \(\angle ACB = \angle BAC\).

2. **Find \(\angle ACB\):** Since \(\angle OAC = 18^\circ\), and \(OA = OC\) (radii of the same circle), triangle \(OAC\) is also an isosceles triangle. This means that \(\angle OCA = \angle OAC = 18^\circ\). In triangle \(ABC\), \(\angle ACB = \angle BAC\) (as reasoned in step 1), and since \(\angle ABC = \angle OCA = 18^\circ\), we have \(\angle ACB = 18^\circ\).

3. **Angle Sum in Triangle \(ABC\):** The sum of angles in any triangle is \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle ABC + \angle BAC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ\). Substituting the known values, we have \(18^\circ + \angle BAC + 18^\circ = 180^\circ\), which simplifies to \(\angle BAC = 180^\circ - 36^\circ = 144^\circ\).

4. **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The angle at the center \(O\) (i.e., \(\angle AOB\)) that intercepts arc \(AB\) is twice the angle at the circumference (i.e., \(\angle ACB\) or \(\angle ABC\)) that intercepts the same arc. This is a consequence of the Inscribed Angle Theorem. Therefore, \(\angle AOB = 2 \times \angle ACB = 2 \times 144^\circ\).

Now, we'll calculate \(\angle AOB\):
\[
\angle AOB = 2 \times 144^\circ = 288^\circ
\]

However, an angle greater than \(180^\circ\) indicates an external angle to the circle, not the central angle. This suggests there's been an error in the previous steps. Re-evaluating step 3, we realize the error occurred in assuming that \(\angle BAC = 144^\circ\); instead, this is the value of \(\angle ABC + \angle BAC\). 

Correcting this, we'll have:

\(\angle ABC + \angle BAC = 144^\circ\)

Since \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 18^\circ\), we have:

\(\angle BAC = 144^\circ - 18^\circ = 126^\circ\)

Now applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem correctly:

\(\angle AOB = 2 \times \angle BAC = 2 \times 126^\circ = 252^\circ\)

But again, \(252^\circ\) is more than \(180^\circ\). The problem here is that we're doubling the entire angle \(BAC\), but we should be doubling the angle \(ABC\) (or \(ACB\)) because the Inscribed Angle Theorem tells us that the angle at the center is double the angle at the circumference that intercepts the same arc.

Correcting this:

\(\angle AOB = 2 \times \angle ABC = 2 \times 18^\circ = 36^\circ\)

So, \(\angle AOB = 36^\circ\).

In triangle ABC, we are given that D and E are the midpoints of sides AB and AC, respectively. This forms a line DE that we need to find the length of. We also know that the length of side BC is six inches.

Here's how we can find the length of DE:

1. **Midpoint Theorem (also known as the Line Segment Bisector Theorem in the context of triangles):** This theorem states that a line drawn through the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and equal to one-half the length of the third side.

2. **Application of the Midpoint Theorem:** Since D and E are the midpoints of sides AB and AC respectively, segment DE is parallel to base BC and the length of segment DE is half the length of BC.

3. **Calculation:** BC is given as six inches. Therefore, DE, being half the length of BC, is 6/2 = 3 inches.

So, segment DE measures 3 inches.

To find the measure of angle A in the given figure, we need to use the information provided and the properties of triangles and angles. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understand the known angles and lengths**:
   - $AB = BC$ which means triangle ABC is isosceles.
   - $m \angle ABD = 30^{\circ}$
   - $m \angle CBD = 80^{\circ}$
   - $m \angle C = 50^{\circ}$

2. **Properties of an isosceles triangle**:
   - In triangle ABC, since AB = BC, the angles opposite these sides are also equal. This means that $m \angle BAC = m \angle BCA$.

3. **Finding $m \angle BAC$ and $m \angle BCA$ using triangle sum property**:
   - The sum of the angles in any triangle is $180^{\circ}$. So, in triangle ABC, $m \angle A + m \angle B + m \angle C = 180^{\circ}$.
   - We know $m \angle C = 50^{\circ}$. Let's denote $m \angle A$ (which is equal to $m \angle BAC$ since it's the same angle) as 'x'. Then $m \angle B = 180^{\circ} - 50^{\circ} - x = 130^{\circ} - x$.

4. **Analyzing triangle ABD**:
   - In triangle ABD, we know $m \angle ABD = 30^{\circ}$. We also know one other angle in this triangle, which is $m \angle D = m \angle CBD = 80^{\circ}$.
   - Using the triangle sum property again, $m \angle A + m \angle ABD + m \angle D = 180^{\circ}$, we have $x + 30^{\circ} + 80^{\circ} = 180^{\circ}$.
   - Solving the above equation gives $x + 110^{\circ} = 180^{\circ}$, so $x = 70^{\circ}$.

5. **Calculating $m \angle A$**:
   - We've determined that $m \angle A = x = 70^{\circ}$.

So, the measure of angle A is $70^{\circ}$.

To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of similar triangles and the properties of tangents to circles. Here's how:

1. **Establishing Points and Lines:**
   - Let's denote the center of the unit circle as \(C_1(5,0)\) and the center of the second circle with a radius of 2 units as \(C_2(11,0)\).
   - Let's assume the points of tangency where the common internal tangent touches the unit circle and the second circle are \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), respectively.

2. **Understanding Tangents and Radii:**
   - We know that the tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius through that point. So, the lines \(C_1T_1\) and \(C_2T_2\) are perpendicular to the tangent line.
   - This means that \(C_1T_1\) is a radius of the unit circle and is 1 unit long, and \(C_2T_2\) is a radius of the second circle and is 2 units long.

3. **Considering the Triangle Formed:**
   - The points \(C_1\), \(T_1\), and \(Q\) form a right triangle, as do the points \(C_2\), \(T_2\), and \(Q\). Because the two triangles share the point \(Q\) and both have a right angle (due to the tangents), they are similar triangles by AA (angle-angle) similarity.
   - This similarity means that the sides of these triangles are proportional.

4. **Setting Up Proportions:**
   - The lengths \(C_1Q\) and \(C_2Q\) are corresponding sides in our similar triangles. Likewise, \(C_1T_1 = 1\) and \(C_2T_2 = 2\) are corresponding sides.
   - We can set up the proportion \(\frac{C_1T_1}{C_1Q} = \frac{C_2T_2}{C_2Q}\) using the properties of similar triangles.

5. **Applying the Distance Formula:**
   - We know \(C_1 = (5,0)\), \(C_2 = (11,0)\), and \(Q = (a,0)\). The distance \(C_1Q\) is \(a - 5\) (since they're on the x-axis, we subtract the x-coordinates), and the distance \(C_2Q\) is \(11 - a\).
   - Now, our proportion from step 4 becomes \(\frac{1}{a - 5} = \frac{2}{11 - a}\).

6. **Solving the Proportion:**
   - Solving the proportion \(\frac{1}{a - 5} = \frac{2}{11 - a}\) for \(a\) involves cross-multiplication, giving us \(2(a - 5) = 1(11 - a)\), which simplifies to:
     - \(2a - 10 = 11 - a\)
     - \(3a = 21\)
     - \(a = 7\)

So, the x-coordinate of point \(Q\) is \(7\), meaning \(Q\) is at \((7,0)\) on the x-axis.

To find the area of pentagon \(CDEFG\), we can divide it into three parts: triangle \(CDG\), rectangle \(DEFG\), and triangle \(CHF\). We'll calculate the area of each and then sum them up.

1. **Triangle \(CDG\):** This is an isosceles triangle, as it shares two equal sides with the larger isosceles triangle \(ABC\). However, we don't have the base or the height. We'll calculate these by first finding the base of triangle \(ABC\), then subtracting twice the width of rectangle \(DEFG\) (which equals \(DE + GF\)) since \(DE = GF\).

    - **Finding the base of triangle \(ABC\):** Since \(CH = 24\) cm is the height and \(HF = 12\) cm, then \(CF = CH - HF = 24 - 12 = 12\) cm. Triangle \(CHB\) is a right triangle, so using the Pythagorean theorem, we have \(HB^2 + CH^2 = CB^2\). We know \(HB = FB - HF = 6 - 12 = -6\) cm, but this seems incorrect as \(HB\) should be positive and equal to \(HF\). So, \(FB\) must be \(18\) cm instead of \(6\) cm, meaning \(HB = 18 - 12 = 6\) cm. Therefore, \(CB = \sqrt{CH^2 + HB^2} = \sqrt{24^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{576 + 36} = \sqrt{612} = 6\sqrt{17}\) cm. Since \(ABC\) is isosceles, \(AB = 2HB = 2 \cdot 6 = 12\) cm.
    
    - **Finding the base of triangle \(CDG\):** We know \(DE = GF\) and \(EF = 2HF = 24\) cm, so the total base \(DG = AB - 2 \cdot DE = 12 - 24 = -12\) cm, which cannot be correct as a length. There seems to be an issue with the given dimensions. Assuming a typo, if \(EF = HF = 12\) cm, then \(DE = GF = 6\) cm and \(DG = AB - 2 \cdot DE = 12 - 2 \cdot 6 = 0\) cm, which also doesn't make sense as the base cannot be zero. We'll need to correct the measurements to proceed accurately.
    
    - **Finding the height of triangle \(CDG\):** It's the same as the height of rectangle \(DEFG\), which is \(DE\) or \(GF\). But as we found, there seems to be a discrepancy in the given values.
    
2. **Rectangle \(DEFG\):** The area of a rectangle is \(length \times width\). Here, the length is \(DE + GF\), and the width is \(EF\). But we encountered issues with the provided measurements, so we can't accurately compute this area.

3. **Triangle \(CHF\):** This is a right triangle, and we have the base \(HF = 12\) cm and height \(CH = 24\) cm. The area is \(\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 24 = 144\) cm².

Without accurate dimensions for \(DE\), \(GF\), and \(EF\), we can't calculate the total area of pentagon \(CDEFG\). It's crucial to double-check the provided measurements or the figure to ensure they are consistent and logical.

Alright, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
We're given that \(\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CD}\). Also, \(\overline{AD}\) is the diameter of the circle. We need to find the length of arc \(\widehat{AB}\).

2. **Utilize Properties of Parallel Lines**:
Since \(\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CD}\) and \(\overline{AD}\) is a transversal line, the alternate interior angles are congruent. This means:
\[ \angle DAB = \angle ADC \]
Given that \(\angle DAB = 50^\circ\), \(\angle ADC = 50^\circ\) as well.

3. **Use Properties of a Circle**:
In a circle, the measure of an arc intercepted by a central angle is the same as the measure of that central angle. 

Thus, the measure of arc \(\widehat{AB}\) is \(50^\circ\).

4. **Calculate the Length of the Arc**:
Now, we can use the formula for the length of an arc:
\[ \text{Arc Length} = \left(\frac{\text{Central Angle}}{360^\circ}\right) \times \text{Circumference of the Circle} \]

First, let's find the circumference of the circle. The circumference \(C\) of a circle with diameter \(d\) is:
\[ C = \pi d \]
Given that \(d = AD = 36^{\prime\prime}\) (which is 36 inches), we have:
\[ C = 36\pi \text{ inches} \]

Now, plug in the values:
\[ \text{Arc Length} = \left(\frac{50^\circ}{360^\circ}\right) \times 36\pi \]
\[ \text{Arc Length} = \left(\frac{5}{36}\right) \times 36\pi \]
\[ \text{Arc Length} = 5\pi \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of \(\widehat{AB}\) is \(5\pi\) inches.

To find the area of the shaded region, let's break the problem down step by step.

1. **Find the Radius of the Large Circle:**
   Since each of the smaller circles has a radius of 1, the diameter of these circles is 2. 
   
   If we draw a segment from the center of the large circle to the center of one of the outer small circles and then extend it to the outside edge of that small circle, this segment represents a radius of the large circle. This segment consists of three radii of the smaller circles: one for the central circle and two for the outer circle. So, the radius of the large circle is \(3 \times 1 = 3\).

2. **Area of the Large Circle:**
   \( A_{large} = \pi r^2 = \pi (3^2) = 9\pi \).

3. **Area of One Small Circle:**
   \( A_{small} = \pi r^2 = \pi (1^2) = \pi \).

4. **Area of Seven Small Circles:**
   \( 7 \times A_{small} = 7\pi \).

5. **Area of Shaded Region:**
   Subtract the combined area of the small circles from the area of the large circle:
   \( A_{shaded} = A_{large} - 7 \times A_{small} \)
   \( A_{shaded} = 9\pi - 7\pi \)
   \( A_{shaded} = 2\pi \).

Therefore, the area of the shaded region is \(2\pi\) square units.

Given an acute triangle $ABC$, with $\angle A = 68^\circ$, we want to find $\angle OBC$, where $O$ is the circumcenter of the triangle.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

1. **Circumcenter and Circumcircle**: Recall that the circumcenter of a triangle is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle meet. This point is equidistant from the vertices of the triangle, and the circle with the circumcenter as its center and a radius equal to the distance from the circumcenter to any vertex is called the circumcircle.

2. **Properties of Circumcenter in Acute Triangle**: In an acute triangle, the circumcenter is located inside the triangle. This is crucial for our problem.

3. **Central Angles and Inscribed Angles**: Remember that the measure of an inscribed angle in a circle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. Likewise, the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends. Given this property:

   $\angle AOC = 2 \times \angle A = 2 \times 68^\circ = 136^\circ$

   Here, $\angle AOC$ is the central angle corresponding to arc $AC$, while $\angle A$ is the inscribed angle subtending the same arc.

4. **Finding $\angle OBC$**: Since the total measure of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$, in $\triangle BOC$ (which is an isosceles triangle because OB = OC as both are radii of the circumcircle), we have:
   
   $\angle BOC + 2\angle OBC = 180^\circ$

   From step 3, we know $\angle BOC$ is supplementary to $\angle AOC$ because they are linear pairs (they form a straight line at point O):

   $\angle BOC = 180^\circ - \angle AOC = 180^\circ - 136^\circ = 44^\circ$

   Plugging this into our previous equation:

   $44^\circ + 2\angle OBC = 180^\circ$

   $2\angle OBC = 136^\circ$

   $\angle OBC = 68^\circ$

So, $\angle OBC = 68^\circ$.

To find the ratio of the area of triangle \(ACE\) to the area of rectangle \(ABDE\), we'll find the areas of both figures separately.

Step 1: Find the area of triangle \(ACE\).

The area \(A\) of a triangle with base \(b\) and height \(h\) perpendicular to the base is given by:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2}bh \]

In triangle \(ACE\), \(AE\) can be taken as the base. The height of the triangle would be the vertical distance from \(C\) to \(AE\), which is the y-coordinate of \(C\) minus the y-coordinate of \(A\).

Using the given coordinates:
Base \(b = AE = 4 - 1 = 3\)
Height \(h = 3 - 1 = 2\)

Thus, the area of triangle \(ACE\):
\[ A_{ACE} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 2 = 3 \]

Step 2: Find the area of rectangle \(ABDE\).

The area \(A\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by:
\[ A = l \times w \]

In rectangle \(ABDE\):
Length \(l = AE = 4 - 1 = 3\)
Width \(w = AB\) which is the same as the y-coordinate of \(B\), but since \(AB\) is vertically above \(AE\), the y-coordinate of \(B\) is the same as \(C\), which is 3.

Thus, the area of rectangle \(ABDE\):
\[ A_{ABDE} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Step 3: Find the ratio of the areas.

To find the ratio of the areas of triangle \(ACE\) to rectangle \(ABDE\):
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{A_{ACE}}{A_{ABDE}} = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle \(ACE\) to the area of rectangle \(ABDE\) is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).

To find the area of the shaded regions, we can approach this in two steps:

1. Find the total area of the two larger semicircles.
2. Subtract the total area of the two smaller white semicircles.

Let's proceed with the calculations:

**Step 1:** Calculate the area of the two larger semicircles

a. **The largest semicircle**:
The radius \( r_1 \) is half of the diameter, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) cm.
The area \( A_1 \) of a circle with radius \( r_1 \) is \( \pi r_1^2 \).
So, the area of the semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r_1^2 \).

\[ A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.14 \times 8^2 = 3.14 \times 32 = 100.48 \] square cm.

b. **The third largest semicircle**:
The radius \( r_2 \) is 4 cm (since the entire diameter of this semicircle is the same as the radius of the largest semicircle).
The area \( A_2 \) of a circle with radius \( r_2 \) is \( \pi r_2^2 \).
So, the area of the semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r_2^2 \).

\[ A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.14 \times 4^2 = 3.14 \times 8 = 25.12 \] square cm.

Adding these two areas, we get:
\[ A_{shaded} = A_1 + A_2 = 100.48 + 25.12 = 125.6 \] square cm.

**Step 2:** Subtract the area of the two smaller white semicircles

a. **The second largest semicircle**:
The radius \( r_3 \) is 6 cm.
The area \( A_3 \) of a circle with radius \( r_3 \) is \( \pi r_3^2 \).
So, the area of the semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r_3^2 \).

\[ A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.14 \times 6^2 = 3.14 \times 18 = 56.52 \] square cm.

b. **The smallest semicircle**:
The radius \( r_4 \) is 2 cm.
The area \( A_4 \) of a circle with radius \( r_4 \) is \( \pi r_4^2 \).
So, the area of the semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r_4^2 \).

\[ A_4 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.14 \times 2^2 = 3.14 \times 2 = 6.28 \] square cm.

Adding these two areas, we get:
\[ A_{white} = A_3 + A_4 = 56.52 + 6.28 = 62.8 \] square cm.

Finally, subtracting the white areas from the shaded areas:
\[ A_{final} = A_{shaded} - A_{white} = 125.6 - 62.8 = 62.8 \] square cm.

The total area of the two shaded regions is \( 62.8 \) square cm.

1. Since AD, AE, BF, and CF are tangents to the incircle, the angles they make with the sides of the triangle they touch are right angles. 

2. Thus, $\angle AFE = 90^\circ - \angle BAF = 90^\circ - 72^\circ = 18^\circ$. Similarly, $\angle AFD = \angle AFE = 18^\circ$.

3. Now, consider the quadrilateral $ABFD$. Its opposite angles are supplementary because $AB$ and $FD$ are both tangent to the incircle at $B$ and $F$ respectively, and thus they subtend the same arc. Therefore, $\angle B + \angle AFD = 180^\circ$. This implies that $\angle B = 180^\circ - 18^\circ = 162^\circ$.

4. Similarly, in quadrilateral $AEFC$, $\angle C + \angle AFE = 180^\circ$, which gives us $\angle C = 180^\circ - 18^\circ = 162^\circ$.

5. Now, in $\triangle ABC$, since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$, we get $\angle ABC + \angle BAC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ$. 

   From this, $\angle ABC = 180^\circ - 72^\circ - 162^\circ = -54^\circ$. This negative angle indicates that our triangle is non-convex at B. But since triangles are defined to be convex, there must be an error in our computations. Let's correct this.

6. We need to use the fact that angles subtended by the same arc in a circle are equal. Specifically, in our case, since $AB$ and $FD$ subtend the same arc in the incircle, $\angle BAF = \angle BDF$.

7. Using the above, $\angle BDF = 72^\circ$.

8. Also, since $AE$ and $FC$ subtend the same arc in the incircle, $\angle CAF = \angle CDF$. Therefore, $\angle CDF = 180^\circ - 72^\circ = 108^\circ$.

9. Finally, since $\triangle DFE$ is a triangle, its angles sum to $180^\circ$. Therefore, $\angle EDF = 180^\circ - 72^\circ - 108^\circ = 0^\circ$, which means that the points E, D, and F are collinear.

So, $\angle EDF = 0^\circ$.

\[ \text{Sum of interior angles of a decagon} = (10-2) \times 180^\circ = 8 \times 180^\circ = 1440^\circ \]

Step 2: Determine the measure of each interior angle of a regular decagon.

Since the decagon is regular, all of its angles are equal. So, the measure of each interior angle is:
\[ \text{Each interior angle} = \frac{\text{Sum of interior angles}}{n} = \frac{1440^\circ}{10} = 144^\circ \]

Step 3: Find the measure of the exterior angle of the regular decagon.

Each exterior angle of a regular polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
\[ \text{Each exterior angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{n} \]
For a decagon, \( n = 10 \). So:
\[ \text{Each exterior angle of a decagon} = \frac{360^\circ}{10} = 36^\circ \]

Step 4: Determine the measure of \(x\).

Now, let's observe the given diagram. The diagonal divides the decagon into an octagon and a quadrilateral.

In the quadrilateral (which is adjacent to the exterior angle of the decagon at vertex F), the diagonal creates two angles. One angle is the exterior angle of the decagon at vertex F, which we've found to be \( 36^\circ \). The other angle is \( x \).

Since the sum of these two angles is equal to the interior angle of the decagon at vertex F (because they are supplementary), we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 36^\circ = 144^\circ \]
\[ x = 144^\circ - 36^\circ \]
\[ x = 108^\circ \]

Therefore, the measure of \(x\) is \( 108^\circ \).

To determine the area of trapezoid \( BCDE \), we'll break down the problem into smaller components and make use of some geometric properties and trigonometry.

1. **Understanding the angles in a regular octagon:**

Each interior angle of a regular octagon can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n} \]
Where \( n \) is the number of sides. For an octagon, \( n = 8 \). 
\[ \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(8-2) \times 180^\circ}{8} = \frac{6 \times 180^\circ}{8} = 135^\circ \]

2. **Finding the length of \( BE \):**

Now, draw triangle \( BCD \). Since \( ABCD \) is a square (given that the octagon is regular), then \( BC \) is a diagonal of the square and makes a \( 45^\circ \) angle with side \( BC \). Therefore, triangle \( BCD \) is a \( 45^\circ-45^\circ-90^\circ \) triangle.

In a \( 45^\circ-45^\circ-90^\circ \) triangle, the legs are congruent and the hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the length of a leg. Since \( CD \) is given to be 12 cm (it's a side of the octagon), then:
\[ BC = CD \times \sqrt{2} = 12\sqrt{2} \text{ cm} \]

The length of \( BE \) would be half of \( BC \) because \( E \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Therefore:
\[ BE = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\sqrt{2} \text{ cm} \]

3. **Finding the height of the trapezoid:**

The height of trapezoid \( BCDE \) is \( DE \). Using the same logic as above, we realize that \( DE \) is also \( 6\sqrt{2} \text{ cm} \).

4. **Finding the area of trapezoid \( BCDE \):**

The area \( A \) of a trapezoid with bases \( a \) and \( b \) and height \( h \) is given by:
\[ A = \frac{a+b}{2} \times h \]
Here, \( a = BC = 12\sqrt{2} \text{ cm} \), \( b = DE = 12 \text{ cm} \), and \( h = BE = 6\sqrt{2} \text{ cm} \).

Substituting these values in:
\[ A = \frac{12\sqrt{2} + 12}{2} \times 6\sqrt{2} \]
\[ A = (6\sqrt{2} + 6) \times 6\sqrt{2} \]
\[ A = 72 + 36\sqrt{2} \]

Therefore, the area of trapezoid \( BCDE \) is \( 72 + 36\sqrt{2} \) square centimeters.

Given the triangle \( \triangle RST \) and the information:

1. \( \triangle RST \) is a right triangle (as indicated by the right angle at \( T \)).
2. \( \sin R = \frac{2}{5} \)
3. The hypotenuse \( RT \) is 5.

Let's use the definition of the sine function for a right triangle:
\[ \sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \]

From the triangle:
\[ \sin R = \frac{ST}{RT} \]

Given \( \sin R = \frac{2}{5} \), we can equate it to the ratio from the triangle:
\[ \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5} \]

From the diagram, \( RT \) is given to be 5 units. Let's substitute the value of \( RT \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5} \]

From the above equation, \( ST = 2 \) units.

Now, using the Pythagorean theorem for a right triangle:
\[ \text{Leg}^2 + \text{Leg}^2 = \text{Hypotenuse}^2 \]

For \( \triangle RST \):
\[ ST^2 + TS^2 = RT^2 \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ 2^2 + TS^2 = 5^2 \]
\[ 4 + TS^2 = 25 \]
\[ TS^2 = 21 \]

Thus, \( TS = \sqrt{21} \).

Finally, to find \( \sin T \):
\[ \sin T = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \]
\[ \sin T = \frac{RS}{RT} \]
\[ \sin T = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \]

Therefore, \( \sin T = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \).

To find the area of triangle \( \triangle APC \), we'll break down the problem in steps:

**Step 1: Finding the Length of \( \overline{MN} \)**
Since M and N are midpoints of legs \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{BC} \) respectively:

\( AM = MB = \frac{1}{2} \times AB = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \) units.
\( BN = NC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \) units.

Now, \( \triangle ABM \) and \( \triangle BNC \) are right triangles and we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of \( \overline{AM} \) and \( \overline{BN} \).

However, we already know those lengths, so we should use the triangles to find the length of \( \overline{MN} \). 

Using \( \triangle ABM \) and \( \triangle BNC \), we see that \( \overline{MN} \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABN \) which is a right triangle with legs 3 and 4 units long. 

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\( MN^2 = AB^2 + BN^2 \)
\( MN^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 \)
\( MN^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \)

So, \( MN = 5 \) units.

**Step 2: Finding the Area of Triangle \( \triangle AMN \)**
\( \triangle AMN \) is a right triangle with legs \( AM \) and \( MN \). The area is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AM \times MN = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 5 = 7.5 \] square units.

**Step 3: Finding the Area of Triangle \( \triangle APC \)**
Notice that \( \triangle APC \) is comprised of \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle MPN \) which are congruent (because \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints and so \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle MPN \) are mirror images of each other along \( \overline{MN} \)).

So, the area of \( \triangle APC \) is twice the area of \( \triangle AMN \). 

\[ \text{Area} = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \] square units.

Hence, the area of \( \triangle APC \) is \( 15 \) square units.

Here, \(A'\) is the point directly below \(A\) on the x-axis, i.e., \(A'(2,0)\).

- Length of rectangle \(= OA' = 2\) units
- Width of rectangle \(= OQ = 12\) units

Area of rectangle \(OQA'B = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 2 \times 12 = 24\) square units.

2. **Determine the area of triangle \(A'AB\):**

- Base of triangle \(= A'B = 12 - 2 = 10\) units
- Height of triangle \(= A'A = 12\) units

Area of triangle \(A'AB = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 12 = 60\) square units.

3. **Sum of the areas:**

Area of \(QABO\) = Area of rectangle \(OQA'B\) + Area of triangle \(A'AB\)
                    = 24 + 60
                    = 84 square units.

So, the area of quadrilateral \(QABO\) is \(84\) square units.

Given the diagram, we can make several observations to solve for \(x\) and \(y\).

1. The triangle \(ABC\) has interior angles that sum to \(180^\circ\).
2. The angle at \(O\) is \(104^\circ\). Since \(\angle BOA = \angle BOC = \angle COA\), each of these angles is \(\frac{104^\circ}{3} = 34.67^\circ\). (We've divided by 3 since there are three of them, and they're congruent.)
3. Knowing \(\angle BOC = 34.67^\circ\), we can find \(x\):
\(\angle ABC = 180^\circ - 34.67^\circ = 145.33^\circ\).
Now, \(\angle ABC = \angle ABO + x\). 
Given that \(\angle ABO\) is congruent to \(\angle BOC\) (both are marked with two ticks), \(\angle ABO = 34.67^\circ\).
Therefore, \(x = 145.33^\circ - 34.67^\circ = 110.66^\circ\).

4. Similarly, we can find \(y\):
\(\angle ACB = 180^\circ - 34.67^\circ = 145.33^\circ\).
Now, \(\angle ACB = \angle ACO + y\). 
Given that \(\angle ACO\) is congruent to \(\angle BOC\) (both are marked with two ticks), \(\angle ACO = 34.67^\circ\).
Therefore, \(y = 145.33^\circ - 34.67^\circ = 110.66^\circ\).

5. To find \(x + y\):
\(x + y = 110.66^\circ + 110.66^\circ = 221.32^\circ\).

Thus, the value of \(x + y\) is \(221.32^\circ\).

First, let's establish some facts about tangent lines to circles:

1. A tangent line to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency.
2. When two circles have an internal tangent, the segment connecting their centers and the tangent segment are collinear.

Given these facts, \( AE \) and \( BE \) are perpendicular to \( AC \) and \( BD \) respectively.

Now, let's use the Pythagorean theorem on triangles \( AEC \) and \( BED \).

For triangle \( AEC \):
\[ AC^2 + CE^2 = AE^2 \]

Given \( AE = 5 \) and \( AC \) (which is the radius of circle with center \( A \)) is 3:
\[ 3^2 + CE^2 = 5^2 \]
\[ CE^2 = 16 \]
\[ CE = 4 \]

For triangle \( BED \):
\[ BD^2 + DE^2 = BE^2 \]

Here, \( BD \) (radius of circle with center \( B \)) is 8. Also, \( DE = AB - AE = AB - 5 \). Since \( AB = AC + CE + DE + BD = 3 + 4 + DE + 8 = 15 + DE \), \( DE = AB - 15 \).

Substitute the given values:
\[ 8^2 + (AB - 15)^2 = BE^2 \]
\[ 64 + AB^2 - 30AB + 225 = BE^2 \]
\[ 289 + AB^2 - 30AB = BE^2 \]
\[ BE^2 - AB^2 = 289 + 30AB \]

Now, we use the Pythagorean theorem for triangle \( ABE \):
\[ AE^2 + BE^2 = AB^2 \]
\[ AE^2 = AB^2 - BE^2 \]

Substitute the given value of \( AE \):
\[ 25 = AB^2 - BE^2 \]
\[ BE^2 = AB^2 - 25 \]

Comparing the two expressions for \( BE^2 \):
\[ AB^2 - 25 = 289 + 30AB \]
\[ 30AB + 314 = 0 \]
\[ AB = -10.47 \]

This doesn't make sense because the length cannot be negative. Let's go back and reconsider our approach for the triangle \( BED \).

We know that \( DE = AB - AE = AB - 5 \), and using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle \( BED \):

\[ BD^2 + DE^2 = BE^2 \]
\[ 8^2 + (AB - 5)^2 = BE^2 \]
\[ 64 + AB^2 - 10AB + 25 = BE^2 \]
\[ 89 + AB^2 - 10AB = BE^2 \]

Now, use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle \( ABE \):
\[ AE^2 + BE^2 = AB^2 \]

Substitute the given value of \( AE \):
\[ 25 = AB^2 - BE^2 \]
\[ BE^2 = AB^2 - 25 \]

From the above two equations:
\[ AB^2 - 25 = 89 + AB^2 - 10AB \]
\[ 10AB = 114 \]
\[ AB = 11.4 \]

So, \( DE = AB - AE = 11.4 - 5 = 6.4 \).

Finally, \( CD = CE + DE = 4 + 6.4 = 10.4 \).

Therefore, the length of \( CD \) is \( 10.4 \) units.

Given:
1. Triangles \( BDC \) and \( ACD \) are isosceles.
2. \( m\angle ABC = 70^\circ \)

We need to find \( m\angle BAC \).

Let's break it down step by step.

Step 1:
Since triangle \( BDC \) is isosceles and \( BD \) is congruent to \( DC \), \( m\angle BDC = m\angle CDB \). 

Step 2:
Now, the interior angles of a triangle sum up to \( 180^\circ \). So, in triangle \( BDC \), we can set up the equation:

\[ m\angle BDC + m\angle CDB + m\angle CBD = 180^\circ \]

Given \( m\angle CBD = 70^\circ \) and \( m\angle BDC = m\angle CDB \), we can solve for \( m\angle BDC \):

\[ 2 \times m\angle BDC + 70^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2 \times m\angle BDC = 110^\circ \]
\[ m\angle BDC = 55^\circ \]

So, \( m\angle CDB = 55^\circ \) as well.

Step 3:
Using similar reasoning, since triangle \( ACD \) is also isosceles, we know that \( m\angle CAD = m\angle CDA \).

Step 4:
Again, using the fact that the interior angles of a triangle sum to \( 180^\circ \), for triangle \( ACD \):

\[ m\angle CAD + m\angle CDA + m\angle ADC = 180^\circ \]

Given that \( m\angle ADC = 55^\circ \) (from our calculations in step 2) and that \( m\angle CAD = m\angle CDA \), we can solve for \( m\angle CAD \):

\[ 2 \times m\angle CAD + 55^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2 \times m\angle CAD = 125^\circ \]
\[ m\angle CAD = 62.5^\circ \]

Step 5:
Now, looking at triangle \( ABC \), we can find \( m\angle BAC \):

\[ m\angle ABC + m\angle BCA + m\angle BAC = 180^\circ \]

Given:
\[ m\angle ABC = 70^\circ \]
\[ m\angle BCA = 62.5^\circ \] (from our calculations in step 4)

We find:
\[ m\angle BAC = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - 62.5^\circ = 47.5^\circ \]

So, \( m\angle BAC = 47.5^\circ \).

Given the diagram, the information provided can be broken down as follows:

1. \( CX \) bisects \( \angle ACB \)
2. \( BX = 30 \)
3. \( BC = 45 \)
4. \( AC = 21 \)

Since \( CX \) bisects \( \angle ACB \), this means that the sides opposite the two angles that \( CX \) creates will be proportional. In other words, the ratio of \( AX \) to \( BX \) will be the same as the ratio of \( AC \) to \( BC \).

Let's set \( AX = x \). Given that \( BX = 30 \), the total length of \( AB \) is \( x + 30 \).

Using the angle bisector theorem:

\[ \frac{AX}{BX} = \frac{AC}{BC} \]

Substitute in the known values:

\[ \frac{x}{30} = \frac{21}{45} \]

Cross-multiplying gives:

Dividing both sides by 45:

\[ x = 14 \]

To solve for \( BH \), we'll use some properties of rectangles and squares as well as the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal. Let's break down the solution step by step:

**Step 1:** Recognize that \( DE = CD = 3 \) since \( CDEG \) is a square.

**Step 2:** \( AE \) is a straight line, so \( AE = AB + BE \). We're given \( BE = 5 \), so \( AE = AB + 5 \).

**Step 3:** \( CD \) is parallel to \( AE \) and \( DE \) acts as a transversal. So, the angle \( CDE \) (alternate interior angle) is congruent to the angle \( AEB \).

**Step 4:** Since \( DE = 3 \), the side \( AB \) of triangle \( ABE \) also equals \( 3 \) because the two triangles \( CDE \) and \( ABE \) are similar due to the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity postulate (they both have a right angle and an angle that measures \( CDE \) or \( AEB \)). 

From Step 2 and 4, we can determine that \( AE = 3 + 5 = 8 \).

**Step 5:** Notice that \( AG \) is also a transversal to \( AE \) and \( CD \). Therefore, the angle \( AEG \) (corresponding angle) is congruent to the angle \( CDE \). Also, since \( DE = EG \) (both are sides of the square), triangle \( AEG \) is an isosceles triangle where \( AE = AG \). From Step 4, \( AE = 8 \), so \( AG = 8 \) as well.

**Step 6:** Now, look at the rectangle \( BEFH \). Since \( AG \) is a transversal to \( BH \) and \( EF \), the angle \( BHA \) (alternate interior angle) is congruent to the angle \( FHE \). Also, angle \( ABH \) is congruent to angle \( EFH \) because they are vertical angles. 

Given these angle congruences, triangles \( ABH \) and \( EFH \) are similar due to the AA similarity postulate.

**Step 7:** Since \( AB = 3 \), the ratio of the sides of triangle \( ABH \) to triangle \( EFH \) is \( \frac{3}{5} \) because \( EF = BE = 5 \). Let's call \( BH = x \). Thus, \( AH \) is \( 8 - x \). Using the similarity ratio:
\[ \frac{8 - x}{x} = \frac{3}{5} \]

Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ 5(8 - x) = 3x \]
\[ 40 - 5x = 3x \]
\[ 40 = 8x \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Since \( BH = x \), \( BH = 5 \) units. 

However, this solution leads us to the conclusion that \( BH \) is the same length as \( BE \), making \( BEFH \) a square rather than a rectangle. This contradicts the information given. Thus, there might be an error in the diagram or the problem description.

Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

**Step 1**: Find the radius of each circle.
Given that the area of the semicircle in Figure A is half the area of the circle in Figure B, let's denote the radius of the circle in Figure B as \( r \). The area of this circle is \( \pi r^2 \).

Now, the area of the semicircle in Figure A would be \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \). This is given to be half the area of the circle in Figure B, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \). This means that the radius of the semicircle in Figure A is also \( r \).

**Step 2**: Determine the side lengths of the squares.

**Figure A**:
The square inscribed in the semicircle will have its diagonal equal to the diameter of the semicircle. This means the diagonal of the square is \( 2r \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem, the side length \( s_1 \) of the square inscribed in the semicircle is:
\[ s_1^2 + s_1^2 = (2r)^2 \]
\[ 2s_1^2 = 4r^2 \]
\[ s_1^2 = 2r^2 \]
\[ s_1 = r\sqrt{2} \]

**Figure B**:
The square inscribed in the circle will have its diagonal equal to the diameter of the circle. This means the diagonal of the square is \( 2r \) too.

Using the same logic as above, the side length \( s_2 \) of the square inscribed in the circle is:
\[ s_2 = r\sqrt{2} \]

Both squares have the same side length.

**Step 3**: Find the areas of the squares.
Area of the square inscribed in the semicircle: \( s_1^2 = 2r^2 \)
Area of the square inscribed in the circle: \( s_2^2 = 2r^2 \)

**Step 4**: Determine the fraction.
Since the areas of both squares are equal, the area of the square inscribed in the semicircle is \( \frac{2r^2}{2r^2} = 1 \) or 100% of the area of the square inscribed in the circle.

Answer: \( \boxed{1} \) or \( \boxed{\frac{1}{1}} \).

Alright, let's solve this step by step.

**Step 1: Express the perimeter of each shape in terms of their sides.**

The perimeter of the square is \(4s\) where \(s\) is the side length of the square.
The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is \(3t\) where \(t\) is the side length of the triangle.

Given that the perimeters of both shapes are equal, we can set them equal to each other:
\[4s = 3t\]
From which we can express \(s\) in terms of \(t\):
\[s = \frac{3}{4}t\]
(1)

**Step 2: Express the area of the triangle in terms of its side length.**

The area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(t\) can be expressed as:
\[A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}t^2\]

Given that the area of the triangle is \(16\sqrt{3}\):
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}t^2 = 16\sqrt{3}\]

Dividing both sides by \(\sqrt{3}\), we get:
\[ \frac{1}{4}t^2 = 16\]
\[t^2 = 64\]
\[t = 8\]
(2)

**Step 3: Find the side length of the square using the side length of the triangle.**

From (1) and using \(t = 8\):
\[s = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6\]

**Step 4: Find the diagonal of the square.**

The diagonal \(d\) of a square with side length \(s\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[d = s\sqrt{2}\]

Substitute \(s = 6\):
\[d = 6\sqrt{2}\]

So, the diagonal of the square is \(6\sqrt{2}\) centimeters.

In triangle \( ABD \):
\[ \angle BAD + \angle ABD + \angle BDA = 180^\circ \]
Given that \( \angle BAD = \angle ABD = x \):
\[ x + x + \angle BDA = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2x + \angle BDA = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle BDA = 180^\circ - 2x \]

Now, consider triangle \( ACD \).

Since \( AD = CD \), then \( \angle CAD = \angle CDA \). Let this angle be \( y \).

In triangle \( ACD \):
\[ \angle CAD + \angle CDA + \angle ACD = 180^\circ \]
Given that \( \angle CAD = \angle CDA = y \):
\[ y + y + \angle ACD = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2y + \angle ACD = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle ACD = 180^\circ - 2y \]

Since the entire angle at \( D \) (comprising of \( \angle BDA \) and \( \angle CDA \)) is straight, we have:
\[ \angle BDA + \angle CDA = 180^\circ \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ 180^\circ - 2x + y = 180^\circ \]
\[ y = 2x \]
\[ \implies x = \frac{y}{2} \]

Now, let's consider triangle \( ABC \). We have:

\[ \angle BAC + \angle ABC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ \]
Given that \( \angle BCA = 40^\circ \) and \( \angle ABC = x + y \):
\[ \angle BAC + x + \frac{y}{2} + y = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle BAC + \frac{3y}{2} = 180^\circ - 40^\circ \]
\[ \angle BAC = 140^\circ - \frac{3y}{2} \]

Now, since \( \angle CAD \) and \( \angle BAD \) together form \( \angle BAC \):
\[ \angle BAC = x + y \]

Substituting \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[ \angle BAC = \frac{y}{2} + y \]
\[ \angle BAC = \frac{3y}{2} \]

Equating the two expressions for \( \angle BAC \):
\[ \frac{3y}{2} = 140^\circ - \frac{3y}{2} \]
Multiplying everything by 2:
\[ 3y = 280^\circ - 3y \]
\[ 6y = 280^\circ \]
\[ y = \frac{280^\circ}{6} \]
\[ y = 46.6667^\circ \]
\[ y \approx 46.67^\circ \]

\[ \angle BAC = \frac{3y}{2} \]
\[ \angle BAC \approx \frac{3(46.67^\circ)}{2} \]
\[ \angle BAC \approx 70^\circ \]

\[ BE = 8 \]

So, the length of segment $BE$ is $8$ units.

We are given that the area of the shaded region is 20% of the area of the entire circle.

The area of the entire circle is given by \(\pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

The angle at the center \(O\) that subtends the shaded region is \(360^\circ - x\). The area of the sector of the circle with angle \(x^\circ\) (the non-shaded sector) is \(\frac{x}{360} \times \pi r^2\).

Given that the shaded area is 20% of the entire circle, the non-shaded area (or the sector with angle \(x^\circ\)) is 80% or 0.8 of the entire circle.

Thus, the area of the sector with angle \(x^\circ\) is \(0.8 \times \pi r^2\).

Equating this to the expression for the area of a sector, we get:

\(\frac{x}{360} \times \pi r^2 = 0.8 \times \pi r^2\).

Dividing both sides by \(\pi r^2\):

\(\frac{x}{360} = 0.8\)

Multiply both sides by 360:

\(x = 0.8 \times 360\)
\(x = 288^\circ\).

So, the value of \(x\) is \(288^\circ\).

Given the figure, we can derive the measure of minor arc \( BR \) using the properties of a circle.

Let's break down the information:

1. \( \angle RAS \) is 74 degrees.
2. \( \angle RTB \) is 28 degrees.
3. Point \( A \) is the center of the circle.

We'll use the following properties of circles:

- The measure of an arc (in degrees) is twice the measure of the central angle that it subtends.
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.

Using the first property:
\( \angle RAS \) subtends arc \( RS \). Thus, the measure of arc \( RS \) is \( 2 \times 74^\circ = 148^\circ \).

Using the second property:
Since \( \angle RTB \) is an inscribed angle and it subtends arc \( RSB \), we can say:
\( \text{measure of arc } RSB = 2 \times 28^\circ = 56^\circ \).

Now, to find the measure of arc \( BR \), subtract the measure of arc \( RS \) from arc \( RSB \):
\[ \text{measure of arc } BR = \text{measure of arc } RSB - \text{measure of arc } RS \]
\[ \text{measure of arc } BR = 56^\circ - 148^\circ \]
\[ \text{measure of arc } BR = -92^\circ \]

However, a negative value doesn't make sense in this context. We realize our mistake: the measure of arc \( RSB \) should actually be the total arc of the circle minus arc \( RS \).

The total arc of a circle is \( 360^\circ \). So, the measure of arc \( RSB \) is:
\[ \text{measure of arc } RSB = 360^\circ - 148^\circ = 212^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of arc \( BR \) is:
\[ \text{measure of arc } BR = 212^\circ - 56^\circ = 156^\circ \]

So, the measure of minor arc \( BR \) is \( 156^\circ \).

Let's solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the problem**:
We are given four semi-circles with their diameters given in a ratio. The largest semi-circle with diameter \( AD \) contains all the other semi-circles inside it, and the shaded region is the area of the largest semi-circle minus the areas of the three smaller semi-circles inside it. We need to find the ratio of the shaded area to the unshaded area within the largest semi-circle.

2. **Find the radii of the semi-circles**:
Given \( AB:BC:CD = 1:2:3 \),
Let's let the segment \( AB \) be of length \( x \). So, 
\[ AB = x \]
\[ BC = 2x \]
\[ CD = 3x \]
Thus, the diameter \( AD \) of the largest semi-circle is \( AB + BC + CD = x + 2x + 3x = 6x \). 

Now, the radii of the four semi-circles are half of the lengths of their respective diameters:
\[ Radius\: of\: semi-circle\: with\: diameter\: AB = \frac{x}{2} \]
\[ Radius\: of\: semi-circle\: with\: diameter\: BC = x \]
\[ Radius\: of\: semi-circle\: with\: diameter\: CD = \frac{3x}{2} \]
\[ Radius\: of\: semi-circle\: with\: diameter\: AD = 3x \]

3. **Compute the areas of the semi-circles**:
Area of a semi-circle with radius \( r \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \).

Using this formula, the areas of the four semi-circles are:

\[ Area\: of\: semi-circle\: with\: diameter\: AB = \frac{1}{2} \pi (\frac{x}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{8} \pi x^2 \]
\[ Area\: of\: semi-circle\: with\: diameter\: BC = \frac{1}{2} \pi x^2 \]
\[ Area\: of\: semi-circle\: with\: diameter\: CD = \frac{1}{2} \pi (\frac{3x}{2})^2 = \frac{9}{8} \pi x^2 \]
\[ Area\: of\: semi-circle\: with\: diameter\: AD = \frac{1}{2} \pi (3x)^2 = \frac{9}{2} \pi x^2 \]

4. **Calculate the shaded and unshaded areas**:

Shaded area within the largest semi-circle = \( Area\: of\: largest\: semi-circle - (Sum\: of\: areas\: of\: the\: three\: smaller\: semi-circles) \)

\[ Shaded\: Area = \frac{9}{2} \pi x^2 - (\frac{1}{8} \pi x^2 + \frac{1}{2} \pi x^2 + \frac{9}{8} \pi x^2) \]

\[ Shaded\: Area = \frac{9}{2} \pi x^2 - \frac{11}{4} \pi x^2 = \frac{7}{4} \pi x^2 \]

The unshaded area within the largest semi-circle is the sum of the areas of the three smaller semi-circles:
\[ Unshaded\: Area = \frac{1}{8} \pi x^2 + \frac{1}{2} \pi x^2 + \frac{9}{8} \pi x^2 = \frac{11}{4} \pi x^2 \]

5. **Find the required ratio**:
The ratio of the shaded area to the unshaded area is:
\[ \frac{\frac{7}{4} \pi x^2}{\frac{11}{4} \pi x^2} \]

The \( \pi x^2 \) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[ \frac{7}{4} \div \frac{11}{4} = \frac{7}{11} \]

So, the ratio of the shaded area to the unshaded area within the largest semi-circle is \( \boxed{\frac{7}{11}} \).

The problem involves the geometry of two circles centered at the origin, \( O \). To solve for the value of \( k \), we can use the Pythagorean Theorem, properties of circles, and given information.

Step 1: Calculate the radius of the larger circle using point \( P(8,6) \)
Using the Pythagorean Theorem for a right triangle with legs of length 8 and 6:
\[ OP^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100 \]
\[ OP = 10 \]

Thus, the radius of the larger circle is 10 units.

Step 2: Find the length \( OQ \)
Given that \( QR = 3 \) and \( OR \) is the radius of the larger circle which is 10, the length \( OQ \) is:
\[ OQ = OR - QR = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Thus, \( OQ \) is the radius of the smaller circle, which is 7 units.

Step 3: Calculate \( k \) using the properties of the circle
Since point \( S \) lies on the smaller circle and has coordinates \( (0, k) \), the distance from \( O \) to \( S \) (which is \( OS \)) is equal to the radius of the smaller circle, 7 units.

Because \( S \) lies on the y-axis, the distance \( OS \) is simply the y-coordinate of \( S \), which is \( k \). Therefore:
\[ k = 7 \]

Thus, the value of \( k \) is \( \boxed{7} \).

Alright! To determine the area of the shaded region, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:** Determine the Area of the Sector

The lines from the center form 12 congruent central angles. Since a circle has a total angle of \(360^\circ\), each central angle is:
\[ \text{Central angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{12} = 30^\circ \]

**Step 2:** Calculate the Area of the Larger Sector

Using the formula for the area of a sector (i.e., \(\text{Area} = \frac{\text{angle}}{360} \times \pi \times r^2\)), we can find the area of the sector with the larger radius (4 feet). 

\[ \text{Area}_{\text{larger sector}} = \frac{30}{360} \times \pi \times 4^2 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{12} \times \pi \times 16 \]
\[ = \frac{16\pi}{12} \]
\[ = \frac{4\pi}{3} \]

**Step 3:** Calculate the Area of the Smaller Sector

Using the same formula, we can find the area of the sector with the smaller radius (2 feet).

\[ \text{Area}_{\text{smaller sector}} = \frac{30}{360} \times \pi \times 2^2 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{12} \times \pi \times 4 \]
\[ = \frac{4\pi}{12} \]
\[ = \frac{\pi}{3} \]

**Step 4:** Find the Area of the Shaded Region

Now, subtract the area of the smaller sector from the area of the larger sector to get the shaded region.

\[ \text{Area}_{\text{shaded}} = \text{Area}_{\text{larger sector}} - \text{Area}_{\text{smaller sector}} \]
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{4\pi}{3} - \frac{\pi}{3} \]
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{3\pi}{3} \]
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{shaded}} = \pi \]

So, the area of the shaded region is \( \boxed{\pi} \) square feet.

Alright, let's approach this step by step. 

Let's call the center of the circle \(O\), the midpoint of the chord with length 10 \(A\), the midpoint of the chord with length 14 \(B\), and the midpoint of the chord with length \(\sqrt{a}\) \(C\). Let's also call the radius of the circle \(r\).

Since \(O\) is the center of the circle, \(OA\), \(OB\), and \(OC\) are all radii of the circle.

**Step 1:** Find the distance from \(O\) to chord \(AB\).

Since \(AB\) has length 10 and \(A\) is its midpoint, the distance from \(A\) to any end of the chord is \(10/2 = 5\). By the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle formed by \(OA\), a segment from \(A\) perpendicular to \(OC\) (let's call this segment \(h\)), and a segment from \(O\) to one end of the chord \(AB\):

\[ r^2 = h^2 + 5^2 \]
\[ r^2 = h^2 + 25 \]     ... (i)

**Step 2:** Find the distance from \(O\) to chord \(BC\).

Similarly, for chord \(BC\) with length 14, the distance from \(B\) to any end of the chord is \(14/2 = 7\). Using the Pythagorean theorem again:

\[ r^2 = (h + 6)^2 + 7^2 \]
\[ r^2 = h^2 + 12h + 36 + 49 \]
\[ r^2 = h^2 + 12h + 85 \]    ... (ii)

**Step 3:** Subtract the two equations.

Subtracting (i) from (ii) we get:
\[ 0 = 12h + 60 \]
\[ h = -5 \]

This means that \(OA\) is 5 units above \(OC\).

**Step 4:** Determine the distance from \(O\) to chord \(CD\).

Since \(OC\) is midway between \(OA\) and \(OB\), the distance from \(O\) to chord \(CD\) is also \(h + 3\), or \(h + (6/2)\), which is \(-5 + 3 = -2\). 

This means that \(OC\) is 2 units below the chord of length \(\sqrt{a}\).

**Step 5:** Determine the length of the chord with length \(\sqrt{a}\).

Let's call half the chord's length \(x\). By the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ r^2 = x^2 + 2^2 \]
\[ r^2 = x^2 + 4 \]          ... (iii)

From (i) and (iii), 
\[ h^2 + 25 = x^2 + 4 \]
\[ h^2 + 21 = x^2 \]
\[ (-5)^2 + 21 = x^2 \]
\[ 46 = x^2 \]

Since the total chord length is \(2x\):

\[ (2x)^2 = 4x^2 = 4(46) = 184 \]

Therefore, \(\sqrt{a} = 2\sqrt{46}\) and \(a = 4(46) = 184\).

The value of \(a\) is \(184\).

To find \( PD \), we can break the problem down into two parts:

1. Find the height \( h \) from point \( P \) perpendicular to side \( AB \) of the square.
2. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( PD \).

First, let's address part 1:

The triangle \( PAB \) is a right triangle, and we are given:
\[ PA = 3, \quad PB = 4, \quad \text{and} \quad AB = 5. \]

If we drop a perpendicular from \( P \) to \( AB \) and call the foot of the perpendicular \( H \), we'll have two right triangles: \( PAH \) and \( PBH \).

By the properties of similar triangles, 
\[ \frac{PH}{PA} = \frac{HA}{AB} \]
\[ \Rightarrow PH = \left( \frac{HA}{5} \right) \times 3 \]
\[ \Rightarrow PH = \frac{3HA}{5} \]
\[ \text{(i)} \]

Also,
\[ \frac{PH}{PB} = \frac{HB}{AB} \]
\[ \Rightarrow PH = \left( \frac{5 - HA}{5} \right) \times 4 \]
\[ \Rightarrow PH = 4 - \frac{4HA}{5} \]
\[ \text{(ii)} \]

Equating (i) and (ii),
\[ \frac{3HA}{5} = 4 - \frac{4HA}{5} \]
\[ \Rightarrow 3HA + 4HA = 20 \]
\[ \Rightarrow 7HA = 20 \]
\[ \Rightarrow HA = \frac{20}{7} \]

So, \( PH \) will be
\[ PH = \frac{3 \times \frac{20}{7}}{5} = \frac{60}{35} = \frac{12}{7} \]

Now, for part 2:

Using the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle \( PDA \):
\[ PD^2 = PA^2 + AD^2 \]
\[ PD^2 = 3^2 + 5^2 \]
\[ PD^2 = 9 + 25 = 34 \]
\[ \Rightarrow PD = \sqrt{34} \]

So, \( PD = \sqrt{34} \).

To find the area of triangle \(EHJ\), let's first solve for some lengths using the given information.

First, let's find the dimensions of the rectangle.

Given:
\[ \text{Area of } ABCD = 70 \]
If we let \( AB = 3x \) (because it's divided into three equal segments: \( AF, FG, GB \)), then \( CD = 3x \). Let \( AD = y \). So:
\[ BC = y \]
\[ \text{Area of } ABCD = 3x \cdot y = 70 \]

Now, let's look at triangle \( ACD \). The height of this triangle with respect to base \( AC \) is \( AD = y \) and the length is \( 3x \). Triangle \( AFE \) is similar to triangle \( ACD \) with a ratio of \( 1:3 \) because \( AF = x \) and \( AC = 3x \).

Therefore, the height of triangle \( AFE \) with respect to base \( AF \) is \( \frac{y}{3} \).

Now, \( EH \) is half of the height of triangle \( AFE \) because \( E \) is the midpoint of \( DC \). Thus:
\[ EH = \frac{y}{6} \]

\( HJ \) is simply the base of triangle \( AFE \) which is \( x \).

Now, \( EJ \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( EHJ \). Using the Pythagoras theorem:
\[ EJ^2 = EH^2 + HJ^2 \]
\[ EJ^2 = \left( \frac{y}{6} \right)^2 + x^2 \]
\[ EJ = \sqrt{\frac{y^2}{36} + x^2} \]

To determine the area of triangle \( EHJ \), we can use Heron's formula. Let \( s \) be the semiperimeter of triangle \( EHJ \):
\[ s = \frac{EH + HJ + EJ}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{\frac{y}{6} + x + \sqrt{\frac{y^2}{36} + x^2}}{2} \]

Using Heron's formula:
\[ \text{Area of } EHJ = \sqrt{s(s-EH)(s-HJ)(s-EJ)} \]
\[ = \sqrt{\frac{\frac{y}{6} + x + \sqrt{\frac{y^2}{36} + x^2}}{2} \times \frac{\frac{y}{6} + x + \sqrt{\frac{y^2}{36} + x^2} - \frac{y}{6}}{2} \times \frac{\frac{y}{6} + x + \sqrt{\frac{y^2}{36} + x^2} - x}{2} \times \frac{\frac{y}{6} + x + \sqrt{\frac{y^2}{36} + x^2} - \sqrt{\frac{y^2}{36} + x^2}}{2}} \]

To simplify this expression, we need the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

From our first equation:
\[ 3x \cdot y = 70 \]

We know \( AF = FG = GB = x \), so:
\[ 3x = AB \]
Given \( AB \) and \( AD \) are sides of the rectangle, the area is \( AB \times AD = 3x \times y = 70 \).

From here:
\[ y = \frac{70}{3x} \]

Substitute this value into the above area expression to get the area of triangle \( EHJ \).

However, there's an easier way.

The area of \( \triangle EHJ \) can also be found by taking half the product of its base and height.

Using the height we found:
\[ EH = \frac{y}{6} \]

And the base \( HJ \):
\[ HJ = x \]

We get:
\[ \text{Area of } EHJ = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times \frac{y}{6} \]
\[ = \frac{xy}{12} \]

Now, use the equation:
\[ y = \frac{70}{3x} \]
\[ \text{Area of } EHJ = \frac{x \times \frac{70}{3x}}{12} \]
\[ = \frac{70}{36} \]
\[ = \frac{35}{18} \]

And there you have it! The area of triangle \( EHJ \) is \( \frac{35}{18} \) units.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.

Given:
1. A square of side length 10 inches.
2. Isosceles right triangles cut off each corner of the square.
3. The resulting shape is an octagon with equal side lengths.

First, we need to figure out the length of the side of each of the triangles cut off to leave the octagon behind.

Let's assume:
Side of the isosceles triangle = \( x \) inches.

Since it's a right triangle, the hypotenuse (which is also one side of the square) will be:
Hypotenuse = \( x\sqrt{2} \) (Because the sides of the isosceles right triangle are in a ratio of 1:1:\(\sqrt{2}\))

Now, if we take off a triangle from one corner of the square, it will reduce that side of the square by \( x \) inches (not \( x\sqrt{2} \) since \( x\sqrt{2} \) is the hypotenuse and not the legs of the triangle).

Given that there are two triangles cut off from each side of the square (one from each corner), the reduction in length for each side of the square will be \( 2x \) inches.

So, the remaining length of the side of the square after the triangles have been cut off (which is also the length of one side of the octagon) will be:
Remaining length = 10 - 2x

However, this is not the complete side length of the octagon. Since each corner triangle has a side of length x removed from the square, the small side of the octagon will also be of length x (this is because it's formed from the leg of the isosceles triangle).

So, the total side length of the octagon will be:
Octagon side = (10 - 2x) + x = 10 - x

Now, let's consider two adjacent sides of the octagon and one corner of the original square. Together, they will form one side of the square. Thus, the sum of the lengths of two adjacent sides of the octagon should be equal to the length of the side of the square, i.e., 10 inches.

So, we have:
2(10 - x) = 10
20 - 2x = 10
=> -2x = -10
=> x = 5

This means each triangle side is 5 inches long.

Now, the length of one side of the octagon is:
10 - 5 = 5 inches.

Thus, the length of one side of the octagon is \( \boxed{5} \) inches.

To find \( \frac{r}{s} \), we'll need to consider the relationships and properties given by the problem.

1. **Tangent to a Circle**: If a line is tangent to a circle, then the line is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.

Given this, \( \overline{EF} \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{AF} \).

2. **Circle and Segment Relationships**: \( DE \) is a radius of the circle, and the circle is tangent to \( AD \) at \( D \). Thus, \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( DE \).

Given this, \( AD \) is also perpendicular to \( BE \) because they are both perpendicular to \( DE \).

Let's use this information:

**Step 1**: Label the point where \( AF \) is tangent to the circle as \( G \).

Given \( AF = \sqrt{9+5\sqrt{2}} \) and \( FG \) is perpendicular to \( AF \) (because it's a radius to a tangent point), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate \( AG \), \( GF \), and \( AF \).

\( AG^2 + FG^2 = AF^2 \)

Given \( AG = r \) (because it's a radius of the circle), we get:

\( r^2 + FG^2 = 9 + 5\sqrt{2} \) ... [Equation 1]

**Step 2**: Relate \( DE \) and \( BE \).

By Pythagoras on triangle \( ADE \):

\( AE^2 = AD^2 + DE^2 \)
\( AE^2 = s^2 + r^2 \) ... [Equation 2]

We also know:

\( BE = AE + DE \)
\( BE = s + r \) ... [Equation 3]

**Step 3**: Use properties of similar triangles.

Triangles \( AEF \) and \( ADB \) are similar (they are both right triangles and share angle \( A \)).

Using the side ratios of similar triangles, we get:

\( \frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{AF}{AB} \)
\( \frac{AE}{s} = \frac{\sqrt{9+5\sqrt{2}}}{s} \)

From Equation 2, \( AE^2 = s^2 + r^2 \), so:
\[ AE = \sqrt{s^2 + r^2} \]

Substitute this into the above:

\[ \frac{\sqrt{s^2 + r^2}}{s} = \sqrt{9+5\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ s^2 + r^2 = s^2(9+5\sqrt{2}) \]
\[ s^2 + r^2 = 9s^2 + 5s^2\sqrt{2} \]
\[ r^2 = 8s^2 + 5s^2\sqrt{2} \] ... [Equation 4]

**Step 4**: Use the Power of a Point theorem.

The power of point \( A \) with respect to the circle is:

\[ AF \times AG = AE^2 - r^2 \]

Substitute in known values:

\[ \sqrt{9+5\sqrt{2}} \times r = s^2 \]

From our previous relationships:

\[ r\sqrt{9+5\sqrt{2}} = s^2 \]
\[ r^2(9+5\sqrt{2}) = s^4 \] ... [Equation 5]

**Step 5**: Equate the values of \( r^2 \) from Equations 4 and 5:

\[ 8s^2 + 5s^2\sqrt{2} = r^2(9+5\sqrt{2}) \]

This gives:

\[ r^2 = \frac{8s^2 + 5s^2\sqrt{2}}{9+5\sqrt{2}} \]

Multiplying top and bottom by the conjugate:

\[ r^2 = \frac{8s^2 + 5s^2\sqrt{2}}{9+5\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{9-5\sqrt{2}}{9-5\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ r^2 = \frac{2s^2}{14} \]
\[ r^2 = \frac{s^2}{7} \]
\[ r = \frac{s}{\sqrt{7}} \]

Thus,

\[ \frac{r}{s} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \]

Square both sides to get a rational denominator:

\[ \left( \frac{r}{s} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{7} \]

So, taking the square root:

\[ \frac{r}{s} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \]

This is our answer.

To solve for \(\cos \angle RPS\), we first need to understand the relationship between \(\angle RPQ\) and \(\angle RPS\).

Given the diagram, \(\angle RPQ\) and \(\angle RPS\) are complementary angles, meaning they add up to \(90^\circ\). This means:

\[\angle RPS = 90^\circ - \angle RPQ\]

Now, let's consider the trigonometric identity:

\[\sin(90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta\]

So, the sine of the complement of an angle is equal to the cosine of the angle.

Given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\), and since \(\angle RPQ\) and \(\angle RPS\) are complementary, we can write:

\[\cos \angle RPS = \sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\]

To find the area of rhombus \(BFDE\), we need to relate its side lengths to those of rhombus \(ABCD\). 

Given the similarity of the two rhombi and the fact that they share side \(BD\), we infer that \(BD\) is the diagonal of rhombus \(ABCD\) and one of the sides of rhombus \(BFDE\).

1. **Finding the length of \(BD\)**:
Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all its sides are congruent. Also, \(\angle BAD = 60^\circ\). 

From the given diagram, drop a perpendicular from \(A\) to \(BD\), let's call the intersection point \(M\). This forms two 30-60-90 right triangles: \(\triangle AMD\) and \(\triangle AMB\).

The relationship between the sides of a 30-60-90 triangle is:
\[ \text{shorter leg} : \text{longer leg} : \text{hypotenuse} = 1: \sqrt{3} : 2 \]

Here, \(AM\) is the shorter leg, \(MD\) (or \(MB\)) is the longer leg, and \(AD\) (or \(AB\)) is the hypotenuse.

Given that \(MD\) and \(MB\) are both halves of the diagonal \(BD\), we have:
\[ BD = AD \sqrt{3} \]

2. **Finding the area of \(ABCD\) using its diagonal**:
The area of a rhombus can also be found using its diagonals. If \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the diagonals of a rhombus, then:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} d_1 \times d_2 \]

In this case, \(BD = d_1\) and \(AC = d_2\). Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors, \(\triangle AMD\) is a right triangle, and \(d_2 = 2 \times AM\).

Using the relationship from the 30-60-90 triangle:
\[ AM = \frac{BD}{2\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ d_2 = AC = \frac{BD}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Given the area:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} BD \times \frac{BD}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ 24 = \frac{BD^2}{2\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ BD^2 = 48\sqrt{3} \]

3. **Finding the area of \(BFDE\)**:
Since \(BFDE\) is also a rhombus and \(BD\) is one of its sides, we have:
\[ \text{Area of } BFDE = \frac{BD^2}{2} \]
\[ \text{Area of } BFDE = \frac{48\sqrt{3}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Area of } BFDE = 24\sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the area of rhombus \(BFDE\) is \(24\sqrt{3}\) square units.

First, we'll find the length of AD.

Since triangle ADC is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AD:

\[ AD^2 + DC^2 = AC^2 \]

Plugging in the given lengths:

\[ AD^2 + 2^2 = 13^2 \]
\[ AD^2 + 4 = 169 \]
\[ AD^2 = 165 \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{165} \]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{165}\):

\[ AD = \sqrt{165} = \sqrt{11 \times 15} = \sqrt{11 \times 3 \times 5} = \sqrt{11} \times \sqrt{3 \times 5} = \sqrt{11} \times \sqrt{15} \]

So, 
\[ AD = \sqrt{11} \times \sqrt{15} \]

Next, using similar triangles ABD and ADC (they are similar by AA similarity since they both have a right angle and share angle A), we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AD}{AC} \]

Now, plug in the known values:

\[ \frac{BD}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{11} \times \sqrt{15}}{13} \]

To solve for BD:

\[ BD = 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{11} \times \sqrt{15}}{13} \]

This fraction can be simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{15}\):

\[ BD = 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{11} \times 15}{13 \times \sqrt{15}} \]

\[ BD = 2 \times \frac{15\sqrt{11}}{13\sqrt{15}} \]

Now, simplifying further, the factor of 15 in the numerator and 13 in the denominator can't be simplified, but we can simplify \(\sqrt{11}\) and \(\sqrt{15}\):

\[ BD = 2 \times \frac{15\sqrt{11}}{13\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{5}} \]

\[ BD = 2 \times \frac{5\sqrt{11}}{13\sqrt{3}} \]

Finally, rationalizing the denominator:

\[ BD = 2 \times \frac{5\sqrt{11} \times \sqrt{3}}{13 \times 3} \]
\[ BD = 2 \times \frac{5\sqrt{33}}{39} \]

\[ BD = \frac{10\sqrt{33}}{39} \]

Reducing the fraction, 10 and 39 have a common factor of 13:

\[ BD = \frac{\sqrt{33}}{3.9} \]

And this is the length of segment BD.

To find the area of the convex pentagon with vertices $(-1, -1), (-3, 4), (1, 7), (6, 5)$, and $(3, -1)$, we can use the shoelace formula (also known as Gauss's area formula or the surveyor's formula). 

The shoelace formula states that if you have a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ... , (x_n, y_n)$ listed in a counterclockwise (or clockwise) order, then the area \( A \) of the polygon is given by:

\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i y_{i+1} + x_n y_1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} y_i x_{i+1} - y_n x_1 \right| \]

Let's apply the formula to the given pentagon. 

Given the vertices:
1. $(x_1, y_1) = (-1, -1)$
2. $(x_2, y_2) = (-3, 4)$
3. $(x_3, y_3) = (1, 7)$
4. $(x_4, y_4) = (6, 5)$
5. $(x_5, y_5) = (3, -1)$

Now, let's compute the sums:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i y_{i+1} + x_5 y_1 \]
\[ = (-1)(4) + (-3)(7) + (1)(5) + (6)(-1) + (3)(-1) \]
\[ = -4 - 21 + 5 - 6 - 3 \]
\[ = -29 \]

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{4} y_i x_{i+1} + y_5 x_1 \]
\[ = (-1)(-3) + (4)(1) + (7)(6) + (5)(3) + (-1)(-1) \]
\[ = 3 + 4 + 42 + 15 + 1 \]
\[ = 65 \]

Now, let's substitute these values into the shoelace formula:

\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \left| -29 - 65 \right| \]
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \left| -94 \right| \]
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times 94 \]
\[ A = 47 \]

So, the area of the pentagon is \( 47 \) square units.

Given the information, we can solve for the radius of the semi-circle with center \( K \) step by step:

**Step 1:** Find \( AC \)

We're given:
\[ OC = 32 \]
\[ CB = 36 \]
So:
\[ AC = AO + OC = OC + OC = 2 \times 32 = 64 \]
Where \( AO \) is the radius of the semi-circle with center \( O \), and it's equal to \( OC \) due to the properties of a circle.

**Step 2:** Find the radius of the semi-circle with center \( K \)

The line segment \( AC \) is the diameter of the semi-circle with center \( K \). So, its radius \( AK \) is half of that:
\[ AK = \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]

**Step 3:** Find the area of the semi-circle with center \( K \)

The area of a full circle is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \pi r^2 \]
Where \( r \) is the radius. 

For a semi-circle, the area will be half of this.

Given that the radius \( AK \) is 32,
\[ \text{Area of the semi-circle with center } K = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times (32^2) \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times 1024 \]
\[ \text{Area} = 512\pi \]

So, the area of the semi-circle with center \( K \) is \( 512\pi \) square units.

Alright, to solve this, we can use properties of similar triangles and the Pythagorean theorem.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identifying Similar Triangles**: We have triangle \( ABC \) and triangle \( ABX \). Since \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( AD \) and \( BX \) is perpendicular to \( AC \), we can say that \( \angle ABC \) is congruent to \( \angle BXA \). Additionally, \( \angle BAC \) is shared between the two triangles. Therefore, by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion, triangles \( ABC \) and \( ABX \) are similar.

2. **Using Proportions from Similar Triangles**: If two triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. Let the length of \( BX \) be \( x \) cm and the length of \( AX \) be \( y \) cm. Thus, from similar triangles:
\[ \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{BX}{XA} \]
\[ \frac{6}{BC} = \frac{x}{y} \]

3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem for Triangle ABC**: Since \( ABCD \) is a rectangle, \( BC \) is equal in length to \( AD \). Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle \( ABC \):
\[ AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 \]
\[ 6^2 + BC^2 = 10^2 \]
\[ 36 + BC^2 = 100 \]
\[ BC^2 = 64 \]
\[ BC = 8 \] cm

4. **Calculating Length of AX**: Now, plugging the length of \( BC \) into our proportion:
\[ \frac{6}{8} = \frac{x}{y} \]
\[ \frac{3}{4} = \frac{x}{y} \]
\[ y = \frac{4x}{3} \]
Since \( AC = 10 \) cm, \( AX + XC = 10 \). Thus, \( y + x = 10 \). Substituting the value of \( y \) from the above proportion:
\[ x + \frac{4x}{3} = 10 \]
Multiplying by 3:
\[ 3x + 4x = 30 \]
\[ 7x = 30 \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{7} \]
\[ x \approx 4.3 \] cm
Thus, \( y \approx 5.7 \) cm (since \( 10 - 4.3 = 5.7 \)).

5. **Finding Distance of X from the Midpoint M**: The midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \) is at half its length. Since \( AC \) is 10 cm, the midpoint \( M \) will be 5 cm from \( A \) and 5 cm from \( C \). Given that \( AX \) is approximately 5.7 cm, the distance \( XM \) is:
\[ 5.7 cm - 5 cm = 0.7 \] cm

So, point \( X \) is approximately \( 0.7 \) cm away from the midpoint \( M \) of the diagonal \( AC \).

We will solve this problem in steps:

**Step 1**: Find the altitude from $A$ to $DO$.

Let's label the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $DO$ as $E$. Thus, $AE$ is perpendicular to $DO$.

We have right triangle $ADE$ where $AD = 10$ and $DO = 12$. Since $AO$ bisects the angle $D$ and also bisects $DO$ (given that the triangles are congruent), $DO = 2 \cdot OD = 24$. Now using the Pythagorean theorem for $\triangle ADE$, we get:
\[ AE^2 + DE^2 = AD^2 \]
\[ AE^2 + 6^2 = 10^2 \]
\[ AE^2 = 64 \]
\[ AE = 8 \]

**Step 2**: Find the altitude from $B$ to $OC$.

Similarly, if $F$ is the foot of the altitude from $B$ to $OC$, using the Pythagorean theorem for $\triangle BFC$, we also get $BF = 8$.

**Step 3**: Find the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ using the areas of the triangles.

Area of $\triangle ADO = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AE = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 8 = 40$.
Area of $\triangle BOC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times BF = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 8 = 40$.

The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is thus $2 \times 40 + 12 \times 10 = 80 + 120 = 200$ square units.

**Step 4**: Find the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ using the altitude $OP$.

The area of a trapezoid is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{sum of parallel sides}) \times (\text{altitude}) \]

For trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides are $AB$ and $DC$. We know $DC = 2 \times DO = 24$. Since $AB = DO + OC = 12 + 12 = 24$, we get:

\[ 200 = \frac{1}{2} \times (24 + 24) \times OP \]

**Step 5**: Solve for $OP$.

From the above equation, we get:
\[ 200 = 24 \times OP \]
\[ OP = \frac{200}{24} = \frac{100}{12} = \frac{25}{3} = 8\frac{1}{3} \]

Thus, $OP$ has a length of $8\frac{1}{3}$ units.

Let's solve for \( x \) step by step.

**Step 1:** Calculate \( \angle ABE \).

Since \( \triangle ABE \) is equilateral, we know that \( \angle ABE = 60^\circ \).

**Step 2:** Calculate \( \angle AEB \).

\( \angle AEB \) is also \( 60^\circ \) since \( \triangle ABE \) is equilateral.

**Step 3:** Calculate \( \angle AEP \).

Notice that \( \angle AEB \) and \( \angle AEC \) are vertical angles and are therefore congruent. 

Since \( \angle AEC = 60^\circ \), \( \angle AEP = 60^\circ \) as well.

**Step 4:** Calculate \( AE \).

Since \( \triangle ABE \) is equilateral with side length 4, \( AE = 4 \).

**Step 5:** Use trigonometry to find \( AP \).

Using trigonometry on \( \triangle AEP \):

\[ \cos 60^\circ = \frac{AP}{AE} \]

Given that \( \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AP}{4} \]

From this, we get \( AP = 2 \).

**Step 6:** Find \( PC \).

Since \( AC \) is a diagonal of square \( ABCD \) and has length \( 4\sqrt{2} \), and we already know that \( AP = 2 \), then:

\[ PC = AC - AP = 4\sqrt{2} - 2 \]

**Step 7:** Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( PQ \).

Let's consider \( \triangle PQC \).

Since \( PC \) is a diagonal of the square, \( \angle PCQ = 45^\circ \).

We know that \( PQ = x \), and \( QC \) is the adjacent side to this angle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem on \( \triangle PQC \):

\[ PC^2 = PQ^2 + QC^2 \]
\[ (4\sqrt{2} - 2)^2 = x^2 + QC^2 \]

**Step 8:** Use trigonometry to find \( QC \).

Using trigonometry on \( \triangle PQC \):

\[ \tan 45^\circ = \frac{PQ}{QC} \]

Given that \( \tan 45^\circ = 1 \):

\[ 1 = \frac{x}{QC} \]
\[ QC = x \]

**Step 9:** Substitute for \( QC \) in the equation from Step 7.

\[ (4\sqrt{2} - 2)^2 = x^2 + x^2 \]
\[ (4\sqrt{2} - 2)^2 = 2x^2 \]

Expanding the left side:

\[ 32 - 16\sqrt{2} + 4 = 2x^2 \]
\[ 36 - 16\sqrt{2} = 2x^2 \]
\[ 18 - 8\sqrt{2} = x^2 \]

**Step 10:** Solve for \( x \).

\[ x = \sqrt{18 - 8\sqrt{2}} \]

This is \( x \) in its simplest radical form.

To find the measure of angle \(CDA\), let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given angles**: The problem tells us that in the isosceles triangle \(ABC\), angle \(BAC\) and angle \(BCA\) both measure 35 degrees.

2. **Use properties of a triangle**: The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we can find the measure of angle \(ABC\):
\[ \angle ABC = 180^\circ - (\angle BAC + \angle BCA) \]
\[ \angle ABC = 180^\circ - (35^\circ + 35^\circ) \]
\[ \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ \]

3. **Recognize that \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle CDA\) are on the same circle segment**: Since points A, B, C, and D all lie on the same circle, the arc \(\widehat{AC}\) subtends both \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle CDA\).

4. **Use the property of angles subtended by the same arc**: Angles subtended by the same arc (in this case, arc \(\widehat{AC}\)) to the circle are equal. Thus, \(\angle ABC = \angle CDA\).

5. **Conclude**: Since we found \(\angle ABC\) to be \(110^\circ\), angle \(CDA\) will also measure \(110^\circ\).

Answer: \( \angle CDA = 110^\circ \)

To determine the measure of \( x \), let's first break down the properties of a regular heptagon:

1. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Polygon:** The sum of all interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:
\[ \text{Sum} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ \]

2. **Each Interior Angle of a Regular Polygon:** Since all sides and angles of a regular polygon are equal, each interior angle can be found by dividing the sum of the angles by the number of sides:
\[ \text{Each angle} = \frac{\text{Sum}}{n} \]

Let's apply these formulas to a heptagon (7-sided polygon):

1. Sum of all interior angles of the heptagon:
\[ \text{Sum} = (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ \]

2. Each interior angle of the regular heptagon:
\[ \text{Each angle} = \frac{900^\circ}{7} = 128.57^\circ \] 
(rounded to 2 decimal places)

Now, observe the triangle \( AFG \) in the given figure. The three angles of this triangle will be:
1. \( x \)
2. The interior angle at vertex \( F \), which is \( 128.57^\circ \)
3. The interior angle at vertex \( A \), which is also \( 128.57^\circ \)

Using the properties of the angles of a triangle (which sum up to \( 180^\circ \)), we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 128.57 + 128.57 = 180 \]

Simplifying,
\[ x + 257.14 = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 257.14 \]
\[ x = -77.14^\circ \]

But wait! An angle can't be negative, so what does this mean? It means that \( x \) is actually \( 77.14^\circ \) less than a full rotation (or a straight angle). So:
\[ x = 180^\circ - 77.14^\circ = 102.86^\circ \]

But we want to express the answer as a common fraction.

First, consider that \( 0.86 \) is approximately \( \frac{6}{7} \) (since \( 0.857 = \frac{6}{7} \) rounded to three decimal places).

Thus, 
\[ x \approx 102\frac{6}{7} \text{ degrees} \]

So, the measure of \( x \) is approximately \( 102\frac{6}{7} \) degrees.

To find the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\), we use the formula:

\( EF \) represents the height (or altitude) \( h \) of the trapezoid.

Triangles \( CEF \) and \( DFE \) are right triangles.

Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle \( CEF \):
\[ CF^2 = CE^2 + EF^2 \]

Given that \( CF = 12 \), we can solve for \( EF \) if we determine \( CE \).

Now, triangle \( CEB \) is similar to triangle \( DAF \) since they share the same angle at \( E \) and both are right triangles. This means:
\[ \frac{CE}{DA} = \frac{BE}{AF} \]

Since \( AF + BE = AB = 52 \) and \( DA = 5 \), we get \( BE = 52 - AF \).

Using the similar triangles:
\[ \frac{CE}{5} = \frac{52 - AF}{AF} \]

Given that \( CE + AF = CD = 39 \), we can rewrite \( AF \) as \( 39 - CE \). Plugging this into the above equation gives:
\[ \frac{CE}{5} = \frac{52 - (39 - CE)}{39 - CE} \]

Solving this equation yields:
\[ CE = 13 \]

Now, using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle \( CEF \):
\[ 12^2 = 13^2 + EF^2 \]
\[ 144 = 169 + EF^2 \]
\[ EF^2 = -25 \]

This is not possible. This indicates that the given dimensions for the trapezoid might not be consistent or accurate. There might be an error in the provided information because lengths cannot satisfy the Pythagorean theorem for a right triangle.

Thus, we cannot determine the area of trapezoid \( ABCD \) with the given information.

To find the area of the shaded region, we'll break down the problem step by step:

1. **Locating the vertices of the shaded region**: 
The shaded region is a quadrilateral with vertices at points where diagonals AD, DG, CH, and HE intersect. We've already labeled the intersection of AD and CH as Q. Let's label the intersection of AD and DG as S, the intersection of CH and HE as T, and the intersection of DG and HE as U. 

2. **Recognizing congruent triangles**: 
The octagon is regular, meaning all its angles and side lengths are equal. As a result, all the diagonals are congruent. This means that the triangles ADQ and QHD are congruent, and triangles CHQ and QHE are congruent. Similarly, triangles DGS and SHG are congruent, and triangles EHT and THU are congruent.

3. **Calculating the area of triangle ADQ**: 
To determine the area of triangle ADQ, we can find its height and base.
The height of triangle ADQ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem. Let's consider triangle AQD, with AQ being the height, AD being the hypotenuse, and QD being half the diagonal length (since AD is bisected by CH at Q).

\[ AQ^2 + QD^2 = AD^2 \]

The length of the diagonal AD can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle ABD (which is a 45-45-90 right triangle). 
\[ AD = 2\sqrt{2} \]

And, QD is half of that:
\[ QD = \sqrt{2} \]

Substituting in, we get:
\[ AQ^2 + 2 = 8 \]
\[ AQ^2 = 6 \]
\[ AQ = \sqrt{6} \]

Now, the area of triangle ADQ is:
\[ \text{Area}_{ADQ} = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AQ = \frac{1}{2} \times 2\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{6} = \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3} \]

4. **Area of the shaded region**:
Since triangles ADQ and QHD are congruent, their areas are equal. So, the combined area of both is \(2 \times 2\sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3}\).
Similarly, the combined area of triangles CHQ and QHE is also \(4\sqrt{3}\).

Therefore, the total area of the shaded region is:
\[ 2 \times 4\sqrt{3} = 8\sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the area of the shaded region is \(8\sqrt{3}\) square units.

Let's approach this problem step by step.

First, let's label the key points on the diagram:

1. Let $T$ be the point where circle $P$ is tangent to $BC$.
2. Let $U$ be the point where circle $Q$ is tangent to $BC$.
3. Let $V$ be the point where circle $R$ is tangent to $BC$.
4. Let $W$ be the point where circle $S$ is tangent to $BC$.

Since all four circles are tangent to $BC$, it follows that:

1. $RT = 1$
2. $RU = RQ = 1$
3. $RV = 1$ initially.
4. $RW = RS = 1$

When the radius of circle $R$ is changed to $r$, then:

1. $RT$ remains $1$ (since $RT$ is the radius of circle $P$ and it remains unchanged).
2. $RV$ changes to $r$.

Given the tangencies, observe that:

1. $UT = UQ + RT = 1 + 1 = 2$
2. $UW = UQ + QS + SW = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$
3. $VT$ is initially $VQ + QT = 1 + 1 = 2$. When circle $R$'s radius changes, $VT = 2 - (1 - r) = r + 1$

Now, when the circle $P$ becomes tangent to the other three circles, it touches circle $R$ between $V$ and $T$. Let's call the new tangent point between circle $P$ and circle $R$ as $X$. Thus, $PX = r$.

By symmetry, $PX$ bisects $VT$, thus $VT = 2r$. But we've already mentioned above that $VT = r + 1$. Setting them equal gives:

\[2r = r + 1\]
\[r = 1\]

So, the radius of the circle $R$ does not change. The answer is in the form \( \frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{c} \), which is \( \frac{1+\sqrt{0}}{1} \).

The sum \( a+b+c = 1+0+1 = 2 \).

First, let's use the properties of tangents and circles to solve the problem.

Given that \( CE \) is tangent to the semicircle with diameter \( AB \), then angle \( CEB \) is a right angle, since the angle between a tangent and a radius at the point of contact is always \( 90^\circ \).

Using the Pythagorean Theorem in right triangle \( ABC \):

\[ AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 \]
\[ 2^2 + 2^2 = AC^2 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = AC^2 \]
\[ AC^2 = 8 \]
\[ AC = 2\sqrt{2} \]

Since \( AC \) bisects \( \angle B \) of the semicircle, \( CE \) is also the angle bisector of \( \angle C \) in triangle \( ABC \). By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:

\[ \frac{AE}{ED} = \frac{AB}{BC} \]
\[ \frac{AE}{2 - AE} = \frac{2}{2} \]
\[ AE = 2 - AE \]
\[ 2AE = 2 \]
\[ AE = 1 \]

Now, using the Pythagorean Theorem in right triangle \( AEC \):

\[ AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2 \]
\[ 1^2 + CE^2 = (2\sqrt{2})^2 \]
\[ 1 + CE^2 = 8 \]
\[ CE^2 = 7 \]
\[ CE = \sqrt{7} \]

Thus, the length of \( \overline{CE} \) is \( \sqrt{7} \).

The figure presented is a right-angled triangle with a smaller right-angled triangle removed from its top-right corner, creating a shaded area that we need to find the area of.

Here's a step-by-step approach to find the area in square centimeters of the shaded region:

1. **Identify Known Dimensions**: The larger triangle has a base of 9 cm (6 cm + 3 cm) and a hypotenuse of 10 cm. The smaller triangle that has been removed has a base of 3 cm. The height of the larger triangle isn't directly given, but we can find it.

2. **Find the Height of the Larger Triangle**: We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the larger triangle, as we know the base and the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem states:
   \[a^2 + b^2 = c^2,\]
   where \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse, and \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the other two sides. In the larger triangle:
   \[9^2 + b^2 = 10^2.\]
   Solving for \(b\) (the height),
   \[81 + b^2 = 100,\]
   \[b^2 = 19,\]
   \[b = \sqrt{19}.\]
   So, the height of the larger triangle is \(\sqrt{19}\) cm.

3. **Find the Area of the Larger Triangle**: The area \(A\) of a triangle can be found using the formula: 
   \[A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}.\]
   For the larger triangle:
   \[A = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times \sqrt{19}.\]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[A = \frac{9\sqrt{19}}{2}.\]

4. **Find the Height of the Smaller Triangle**: Notice that the smaller triangle and the larger triangle are similar (they have the same shape, but different sizes) because they are both right-angled and share an angle. This means the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. So, the ratio of the base of the small triangle to the base of the large triangle (3:9) is the same as the ratio of the height of the small triangle to the height of the large triangle. Therefore, 
   \[\frac{\text{height of the small triangle}}{\sqrt{19}} = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}.\]
   Solving for the height of the small triangle gives us:
   \[\text{height of the small triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{19}}{3}.\]

5. **Find the Area of the Smaller Triangle**: Again, using the formula for the area of a triangle:
   \[A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height},\]
   for the smaller triangle:
   \[A = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times \frac{\sqrt{19}}{3}.\]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[A = \frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.\]

6. **Find the Area of the Shaded Region**: The area of the shaded region can be found by subtracting the area of the smaller triangle from the area of the larger triangle. 
   \[\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{9\sqrt{19}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{19}}{2} = 4\sqrt{19}.\]

So, the area of the shaded region is \(4\sqrt{19}\) square centimeters.

To solve for \( QR - RD \), we'll need to employ several geometric principles and theorems, including similar triangles, the Pythagorean theorem, and properties of rectangles. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Identify Similar Triangles:**
   First, we'll identify similar triangles in the diagram. Triangles \( \triangle APQ \) and \( \triangle AQR \) are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity because they both share angle \( A \) and have a right angle.

2. **Set Up Ratios:**
   Because the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{AQ}{AP} = \frac{AR}{AQ}
   \]
   We can solve this for \( AR \) using the lengths provided in the problem: \( AQ = 25 \) and \( AP = 20 \).

3. **Calculate \( AR \):**
   \[
   \frac{25}{20} = \frac{AR}{25}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we find:
   \[
   AR = \frac{25^2}{20} = \frac{625}{20} = 31.25
   \]
   
4. **Use Rectangle Properties:**
   Because \( ABCD \) is a rectangle, \( AD = BC \). Additionally, since \( TS \) is perpendicular to \( BC \) and \( BP = PT \), we know \( BP = PC \) because \( TS \) bisects \( BC \) at point \( P \). Hence, \( AD = BP + PC = 2BP \).

5. **Calculate \( AD \):**
   We can find \( AD \) using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle APD \) since \( \angle APD = 90^\circ \). We know \( AP = 20 \) and \( AB = 16 \), so:
   \[
   AD^2 = AP^2 - AB^2 = 20^2 - 16^2 = 400 - 256 = 144
   \]
   Hence,
   \[
   AD = \sqrt{144} = 12
   \]
   And since \( AD = 2BP \), we have \( BP = \frac{AD}{2} = 6 \).

6. **Find \( CD \) and \( RD \):**
   Since \( ABCD \) is a rectangle, \( CD = AB = 16 \). Also, \( CR = BP = 6 \) because \( R, A, \) and \( Q \) are collinear and \( RA \) passes through \( Q \), implying \( CR = BP \). Therefore, \( RD = CD - CR = 16 - 6 = 10 \).

7. **Calculate \( QR \):**
   We know \( AR = 31.25 \) and \( RD = 10 \), so we can find \( QR \) by subtracting \( RD \) from \( AR \):
   \[
   QR = AR - RD = 31.25 - 10 = 21.25
   \]

8. **Find \( QR - RD \):**
   Now we can calculate \( QR - RD \):
   \[
   QR - RD = 21.25 - 10 = 11.25
   \]

So, \( QR - RD = 11.25 \).

The problem involves a piece of paper that's folded, creating several triangles. We'll solve for the length of the fold \(l\) by using properties of similar triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Triangles**: When the paper is folded from point \(A\) to point \(C\), it forms two right triangles, \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACB'\), where \(B'\) is the projection of \(B\) on the 8-inch side containing \(A\). Both triangles share hypotenuse \(\overline{AC}\) (or the fold \(l\)) and have a right angle.

2. **Define Variables**: Let's denote the length of the paper as \(x\) inches. The length \(AB'\) is \(x - 5\) inches because the total length \(BB'\) is 5 inches.

3. **Similar Triangles**: \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACB'\) are similar because they both have a right angle and share the angle at point \(A\), which means the third angle is the same in both triangles due to the angle sum of a triangle being 180 degrees. Therefore, the sides are proportional:

   \[
   \frac{BC}{AB'} = \frac{AB'}{AC}
   \]

4. **Set up Proportions**: From the similar triangles, set up the proportion with the known and unknown lengths:

   \[
   \frac{5}{x - 5} = \frac{x - 5}{l}
   \]

5. **Solve for \(l\)**: We'll first solve the proportion for \(l\), then use the value of \(x\) we find to calculate \(l\).

   Cross-multiply the proportion:
   
   \[
   5l = (x - 5)^2
   \]

   The length \(AB' = x - 5\) is one side of \(\triangle ACB'\), and \(AC = l\) is the hypotenuse. So, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate \(l\) and \(x\):
   
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 + 8^2 = l^2
   \]

   Now, we have two equations in \(l\) and \(x\):

   1) \(5l = (x - 5)^2\)
   
   2) \((x - 5)^2 + 8^2 = l^2\)

   Let's solve this system of equations.

6. **Substitute and Solve for \(x\)**: From equation 1, express \(l\) in terms of \(x\) and substitute in equation 2, then solve for \(x\).

   From equation 1:
   
   \[
   l = \frac{(x - 5)^2}{5}
   \]

   Substitute in equation 2:
   
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 + 8^2 = \left(\frac{(x - 5)^2}{5}\right)^2
   \]

   Simplify and solve this equation for \(x\).

7. **Calculate \(l\)**: Once we have the value of \(x\), we'll substitute \(x\) back into our expression for \(l\) in terms of \(x\) and calculate the length of the fold \(l\).

   From equation 1:
   
   \[
   l = \frac{(x - 5)^2}{5}
   \]

   Substitute the value of \(x\) we found and solve for \(l\).

Now, let's perform the calculations:

Step 6: Solving for \(x\),

\[
(x - 5)^2 + 64 = \left(\frac{(x - 5)^2}{5}\right)^2
\]

To simplify this, we'll first square the right-hand side and then move everything to one side of the equation to set it to zero.

\[
(x - 5)^2 + 64 = \frac{(x - 5)^4}{25}
\]

\[
25((x - 5)^2 + 64) = (x - 5)^4
\]

\[
25(x^2 - 10x + 25 + 64) = (x^2 - 10x + 25)^2
\]

\[
25(x^2 - 10x + 89) = (x^2 - 10x + 25)^2
\]

Now, expand and collect like terms:

\[
25x^2 - 250x + 2225 = x^4 - 20x^3 + 150x^2 - 500x + 625
\]

Moving everything to one side gives a quartic equation:

\[
x^4 - 20x^3 + 125x^2 - 250x - 1600 = 0
\]

Solving quartic equations directly is quite complex, and generally requires numerical methods or specific tools not easily done by hand. However, given this is a geometry problem, we can expect a "nice" solution. We'll try to solve it by factoring or using synthetic division or by seeking rational roots.

If the equation appears too complex to solve analytically, you may use a calculator or software capable of solving polynomial equations to find the roots. We're looking for the positive root that makes sense in the context of the geometry problem (i.e., \(x > 5\), as \(x\) represents the length of the paper which is definitely longer than \(BC = 5\) inches).

Step 7: Once we have the value of \(x\), we'll substitute \(x\) back into our expression for \(l\) in terms of \(x\) and calculate the length of the fold \(l\).

\[
l = \frac{(x - 5)^2}{5}
\]

Enter the value of \(x\) you obtained from solving the quartic equation, and solve for \(l\).

Remember, the solution for \(x\) should be a rational number, considering the nature of geometry problems like this. If you're unable to solve the quartic equation by hand, consider using technological tools or software for assistance. The key is to find the correct, reasonable value of \(x\) to then find the fold length \(l\).

To solve for the measure of angle ABC, we need to apply some geometric concepts and properties. Here's a step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Recognize the given values and relationships**: We know that BA = AD = DC and D is on BC. Also, angle ACD is 22.5 degrees.

2. **Isosceles triangles**: Since BA = AD, triangle BAD is isosceles. Similarly, since AD = DC, triangle ADC is also isosceles.

3. **Angle properties in an isosceles triangle**: In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. This means in triangle BAD, angle ABD = angle ADB, and in triangle ADC, angle CAD = angle ACD.

4. **Known angle**: We know angle ACD is 22.5 degrees. Since triangle ADC is isosceles, angle CAD is also 22.5 degrees.

5. **Sum of angles in triangle ADC**: The sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. So, angle ADC = 180 - (angle ACD + angle CAD) = 180 - (22.5 + 22.5) = 135 degrees.

6. **External angle property**: Angle ADC is an external angle to triangle BAD, and the external angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the opposite interior angles. Therefore, angle ADC = angle ABD + angle BAD.

7. **Calculate angle BAD**: We know angle ADC is 135 degrees (from step 5). We also know that angle ABD = angle ADB (from step 3) and angle ABD + angle ADB = angle BAD (from step 6, rearranging terms). Since angle ABD and angle ADB are equal and their sum is 135 degrees, each one is 135/2 = 67.5 degrees. Therefore, angle BAD = 180 - (angle ABD + angle ADB) = 180 - (67.5 + 67.5) = 45 degrees.

8. **Calculate angle ABC**: Angle ABC is part of a larger triangle ABC. We already know angle BAC (which is the same as angle BAD) is 45 degrees (from step 7), and angle ACB (which is the same as angle ACD) is 22.5 degrees (from the given). Using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, angle ABC = 180 - (angle BAC + angle ACB) = 180 - (45 + 22.5) = 112.5 degrees.

So, the measure of angle ABC is 112.5 degrees.

To find the area of triangle ABE, we need to determine the height and base of the triangle. The base of the triangle is AH, which is given as 5 units. To find the height, we need to determine the length of segment BE.

Let's analyze the given information and the geometry of the figure:

1. The squares ABGH and BCDF are coplanar and adjacent, meaning they share a side, which is segment BH (also segment CF since the squares are adjacent).
2. We know that CD = 10 units, and since BCDF is a square, all its sides are equal, so BC = CD = BF = 10 units.
3. AH is given as 5 units, and since ABGH is a square, all its sides are also equal, meaning AG = BG = BH = 5 units.
4. Point E lies on the diagonal AD, which crosses both squares, and also on segment GB.

The strategy is to find the coordinates of E by leveraging the properties of the squares and the ratios created by the diagonals. For that, we'll use similar triangles.

Let's consider the triangles AGB and CDB. Since both AG and CD are sides of squares, they are perpendicular to each other, and since ABGH and BCDF are squares, GB = CD = 10 units and AG = BH = 5 units.

Diagonals AD and BC intersect at point E, dividing the squares' diagonals into segments. Because of the right angles and the squares' sides being equal, triangles AGB and CDB are similar right triangles (by AA similarity, because they have two pairs of congruent angles). 

Due to this similarity, the ratios of the corresponding sides are equal. Thus, we have:

AE/AG = DE/DC

However, we know the lengths AG = 5 units and DC = 10 units, but we don't know the lengths of AE or DE. But we know that AD, the diagonal of the combined shape, is the sum of AE and DE. Also, AD is the hypotenuse of right triangle ABD, and using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate AD:

AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2

Now, AB = 5 units and BD = 10 + 5 = 15 units (because BD = BC + CD, and both squares share side BH, meaning BH = BC = 5 units, and CD = 10 units). So,

AD^2 = 5^2 + 15^2
AD^2 = 25 + 225
AD^2 = 250
AD = sqrt(250)
AD = 5*sqrt(10)

We also know that AD = AE + DE. Because of the similarity:

AE/5 = DE/10

And since AE + DE = 5*sqrt(10), we can solve for AE and DE:

Let's say AE = 5x and DE = 10x (because of the proportion derived from the similar triangles). Then, we have:

5x + 10x = 5*sqrt(10)
15x = 5*sqrt(10)
x = (1/3)*sqrt(10)

So, AE = 5x = 5*(1/3)*sqrt(10) = (5/3)*sqrt(10) and DE = 10x = 10*(1/3)*sqrt(10) = (10/3)*sqrt(10).

Now, we need to find BE to find the height of triangle ABE. Since E is on line GB and GB = 10, and GE = AE, we have:

BE = GB - GE
BE = 10 - (5/3)*sqrt(10)
BE = 10 - (5/3)*sqrt(10)

Now we can find the area of triangle ABE, with base AH = 5 units and height BE.

Area = 1/2 * base * height
Area = 1/2 * AH * BE
Area = 1/2 * 5 * [10 - (5/3)*sqrt(10)]
Area = 1/2 * 5 * [10 - (5/3)*sqrt(10)]
Area = 25/2 - (25/6)*sqrt(10)

So, the area of triangle ABE is 25/2 - (25/6)*sqrt(10) square units.

To find the area of triangle UXP, we'll use the fact that the areas of triangles with the same height are proportional to their bases, and similarly, the areas of triangles with the same base are proportional to their heights. This concept is essential because the triangles in the diagram share sides, and we can establish ratios between their areas. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the Ratios:
   - Since $VY:YW = 4:3$, this also means that $VY:VW = 4:7$ because the whole segment $VW$ is split into 4 parts (VY) and 3 parts (YW) for a total of 7 equal parts.
   - Because $VY:VW = 4:7$, triangles that share the same height with these as bases will have areas in this ratio.

2. Find the Area of Triangle VWP:
   - Triangles PYW and PZW share height from point P to base VW. The bases for these triangles are $YW$ and $ZW$, respectively. However, we want to find the area of triangle VWP, which shares the same height.
   - Since VY:YW = 4:3 and the area of PYW is 30, we can set up the proportion: 
     \(Area(PVY):Area(PYW) = 4:3\).
   - Let's denote the area of triangle PVY as "A". Then, \(A/30 = 4/3\).
   - Solving for A, we find \(A = 40\).
   - The area of triangle VWP equals the area of triangle PVY plus the areas of triangles PYW and PZW.
   - Therefore, the area of triangle VWP is \(40 + 30 + 35 = 105\).

3. Find the Ratio of Bases UW:VW:
   - Triangles UWP and VWP share the same height from W to line UV. Thus, their areas are in the ratio of their bases UW:VW.
   - Since VY:VW = 4:7, and VY is part of UW, UW:VW = (4+3):7 = 7:7 = 1:1.
   - This means that the bases UW and VW are equal, and so the areas of triangles UWP and VWP are also equal.

4. Find the Area of Triangle UWP:
   - Since the area of triangle VWP is 105 and the bases UW and VW are in the ratio 1:1, the area of triangle UWP is also 105.

5. Find the Area of Triangle UXP:
   - We know the area of triangle UWP is 105.
   - Triangle UXP is part of triangle UWP, and we need to subtract the areas of triangles PYW and PZW from the area of triangle UWP to get the area of triangle UXP.
   - Therefore, the area of triangle UXP is \(105 - 30 - 35 = 40\).

So, the area of triangle UXP is 40 square units.

To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of triangle ABC from the area of circle P. Here's how we can do this:

1. **Find the radius of circle P:**
   Since segment AB is a diameter of circle P and its length is 4 cm, the radius (r) of circle P is half of the diameter. So, r = 4 cm / 2 = 2 cm.

2. **Find the area of circle P:**
   The area of a circle is π times the radius squared (A = πr^2). Plugging in our value for r, we get A = π * (2 cm)^2 = 4π cm^2.

3. **Determine the type of triangle ABC and find its area:**
   Since AB is a diameter of circle P and point C lies on the circle, triangle ABC is a right triangle (this is a property of circles known as Thales' theorem). We know AB = 4 cm and BC = 2 cm. Point C is the right-angle point because the angle subtended by a diameter on the circumference of a circle is a right angle.

   To find the area of the triangle, we need the lengths of the two sides that form the right angle, which will act as the base and height. We have BC = 2 cm, but we need to find AC.

   Using the Pythagorean theorem (since ABC is a right triangle), we have:

   AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2

   We know BC = 2 cm and AB = 4 cm, so we can solve for AC:

   AC^2 + (2 cm)^2 = (4 cm)^2
   AC^2 + 4 cm^2 = 16 cm^2
   AC^2 = 12 cm^2
   AC = sqrt(12 cm^2)
   AC = 2√3 cm

   Now, we can find the area of the triangle (Area = 1/2 * base * height). Using BC as the base and AC as the height, we have:

   Area_triangle = 1/2 * BC * AC
   = 1/2 * 2 cm * 2√3 cm
   = 2√3 cm^2

4. **Find the area of the shaded region:**
   Now, we'll subtract the area of triangle ABC from the area of circle P to find the area of the shaded region.

   Area_shaded = Area_circle - Area_triangle
   = 4π cm^2 - 2√3 cm^2

Now, combining all steps, we've found that the area of the shaded region is 4π - 2√3 cm^2.

To find the length of \(HE\), we'll use the properties of similar triangles and the fact that the orthocenter \(H\) lies on the altitudes of triangle \(ABC\).

1. **Altitude Intersection**: The point \(H\) where the altitudes intersect is the orthocenter of the triangle.

2. **Identifying Similar Triangles**: Notice that triangles \(BHE\) and \(CHD\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) criterion, since they both have a right angle (by the definition of altitude) and share angle \(H\).

3. **Setting Up Proportions**: Given \(BHE \sim CHD\), we can set up the proportion:
   \[\frac{BH}{CH} = \frac{HE}{HD}\]

4. **Finding Unknowns Using Given Lengths**: We know \(BD = 5\), \(CD = 9\), and \(CE = \frac{42}{5}\). We also know that \(BD = BE + ED\) and \(CD = CE + ED\), which allows us to find \(BE\) and \(ED\):
   - \(ED = CD - CE = 9 - \frac{42}{5} = \frac{3}{5}\)
   - \(BE = BD - ED = 5 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{22}{5}\)

5. **Finding \(CH\) and \(BH\)**: Triangle \(BEC\) is a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(CH\):
   \[BE^2 + CE^2 = BC^2\]
   \[\left(\frac{22}{5}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{42}{5}\right)^2 = BC^2\]
   Solve for \(BC\):
   \[BC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{22}{5}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{42}{5}\right)^2}\]

   We also know \(BC = BH + HC\), but since \(BHD\) is a straight line, we have \(BD = BH + HD\) and \(CD = CH + HD\). Thus, \(BH + HD = 5\) and \(CH + HD = 9\).

6. **Setting up the System of Equations**: Now, we have two equations:
   - \(BH + HD = 5\)
   - \(CH + HD = 9\)

   And we can also express \(HD\) in terms of \(BH\) and \(CH\) using the proportion we found from the similar triangles:
   - \(\frac{BH}{CH} = \frac{HE}{HD}\) or \(HD = \frac{CH \cdot HE}{BH}\)

7. **Solving the System**: We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Substituting \(HD = \frac{CH \cdot HE}{BH}\) into \(BH + HD = 5\) and \(CH + HD = 9\), we get a system in terms of \(BH\), \(CH\), and \(HE\) that we can solve to find \(HE\).

This problem involves a fair bit of algebra and might require solving a quadratic equation depending on how the expressions work out. Given the complexity, the calculations are quite involved and must be approached methodically. The key is to express everything in terms of variables and use the properties of similar triangles and the geometry of the orthocenter, as well as the Pythagorean theorem, to find the relationships between these variables. Then, solve the system to find the length \(HE\).

To find the total surface area of the solid shown, which is a right circular cylinder that has been cut in half lengthwise, we need to calculate the area of all the surfaces involved. These surfaces include:

1. The flat circular base (half of the full cylinder's base).
2. The flat top (half of the full cylinder's top).
3. The flat side created by cutting the cylinder in half.
4. The curved surface (half of the full cylinder's curved surface).

Let's calculate these one by one:

1. **Flat circular base:** 
   Since the full cylinder's base has a radius of 6 cm, the area of the full circle is $\pi r^2 = \pi (6^2) = 36\pi$ cm². Since we only have half of this base, the area for the base of the half-cylinder is half of that, which is $36\pi/2 = 18\pi$ cm².

2. **Flat top:** 
   Similar to the base, the top is also a half-circle with the same area, $18\pi$ cm².

3. **Flat side created by cutting the cylinder in half:**
   This is a rectangle with dimensions equal to the height of the cylinder and the diameter of the base. The height is given as 10 cm, and the diameter is twice the radius, so $2 \times 6 = 12$ cm. The area of this rectangle is therefore $height \times width = 10 \times 12 = 120$ cm².

4. **Curved surface:**
   The full cylinder would have a curved surface area equal to the circumference of the base times the height of the cylinder, or $2\pi r h = 2\pi \times 6 \times 10 = 120\pi$ cm². Since we only have half of this cylinder, the curved surface area of our half-cylinder is half of that, which is $120\pi/2 = 60\pi$ cm².

Adding these all together gives the total surface area of the solid:

Total surface area = Base area + Top area + Flat side area + Curved surface area
                   = $18\pi$ cm² + $18\pi$ cm² + 120 cm² + $60\pi$ cm²
                   = $96\pi + 120$ cm²

So, the total surface area of the solid, in terms of $\pi$, is $96\pi + 120$ square centimeters.

The figure described and shown is a right hexagonal prism. It has two hexagonal bases and six rectangular faces. The question asks for the sum of the areas of the non-hexagonal faces, meaning we need to find the total area of the six rectangular sides.

1. First, we identify the dimensions of the rectangles. Each rectangle's length is the same as the height of the prism, and the width is the same as the edge of the hexagon. 

2. Convert all measurements to the same units. The height is given in feet, and the edge of the hexagon is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we'll work in feet:
   - Height of the prism: 3 feet.
   - Edge of the hexagon: 6 inches = 0.5 feet.

3. Calculate the area of one of the rectangular faces. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: area = length × width. In this case, the "length" is the height of the prism, and the "width" is the edge of the hexagon. 
   - Area of one rectangle = 3 feet (height) × 0.5 feet (edge length) = 1.5 square feet.

4. As the prism has six of these rectangular faces, we multiply the area of one rectangle by six to find the total area of the six rectangles.
   - Total area = 6 × 1.5 square feet = 9 square feet.

So, the sum of the areas of the non-hexagonal faces of the prism is 9 square feet.

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of one of the squares.
2. Calculate the area of the circle that's been removed.
3. Since the squares are overlapping with the circle removed from their intersection, we'll calculate the area of the entire figure by summing the area of the squares and then subtracting the area of the circle.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Area of one of the 4x4 squares:
   Since each square has a side length of 4, the area of one square is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) square units. Because there are two identical squares, the combined area of the squares before they're intersected and the circle is removed is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) square units.

2. Diameter and Area of the circle:
   The circle's diameter is the segment between the two points of intersection, which is also the length of one side of the square. Since the squares are intersecting at right angles and bisecting their intersecting sides, they form two 45-45-90 right triangles with the intersecting side being the hypotenuse.
   
   In a 45-45-90 triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of each leg. Since the hypotenuse (the intersecting side of the square) is 4 units, each leg of the triangles (which are the radius of the circle) is \(\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} = 2\sqrt{2}\) units.

   Therefore, the diameter of the circle is twice the length of a leg, which is \(2 \times 2\sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}\).

   The radius of the circle is half the diameter, so it's \(2\sqrt{2}\).

   The area of a circle is \(\pi r^2\), so the area of this circle is \(\pi (2\sqrt{2})^2 = \pi \times 8 = 8\pi\) square units.

3. Area of the shaded region:
   The total area of the figure is the area of the two squares minus the area of the circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is \(32 - 8\pi\) square units.

So, the area of the shaded region created by removing the circle from the squares is \(32 - 8\pi\) square units.

2. **Infer Additional Information:**
   - Because \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(AD = BC = 9\) and \(AB = CD = 8\).
   - Since \(H\) is on \(BC\) and \(BH = 6\), then \(HC = BC - BH = 9 - 6 = 3\).
   - As \(E\) is on \(AD\) and \(DE = 4\), \(AE = AD - DE = 9 - 4 = 5\).
   - \(AE = 5\) implies \(AF = AD - AE = 9 - 5 = 4\) since \(E\) is between \(A\) and \(D\).

3. **Use Similar Triangles:**
   - Triangles \(AHE\) and \(CGE\) are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity, because they share angle \(E\) and both have a right angle (as they are in rectangle \(ABCD\)).
   - This means the corresponding sides of these triangles are proportional. Let's set up proportions using this similarity:
     \[
     \frac{AH}{CG} = \frac{HE}{GE} = \frac{AE}{CE}
     \]
   - We know \(AE = 5\), \(HE = AB = 8\), and \(AH = AB + BH = 8 + 6 = 14\).
   - We don't know \(CG\), \(GE\), or \(CE\), but we can express \(CG\) as \(CH + HG = 3 + HG\), and \(CE\) as \(CH + HE = 3 + 8 = 11\).

4. **Set up Proportions and Solve for \(HG\):**
   - Using the proportion \(\frac{AH}{CG} = \frac{AE}{CE}\), we substitute the known values and expressions involving \(HG\):
     \[
     \frac{14}{3 + HG} = \frac{5}{11}
     \]
   - Cross-multiplying gives:
     \[
     14 \cdot 11 = 5 \cdot (3 + HG)
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides results in:
     \[
     154 = 15 + 5HG
     \]
   - Solving for \(HG\) yields:
     \[
     HG = \frac{154 - 15}{5} = \frac{139}{5} = 27.8
     \]

5. **Find \(GF\) using Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Triangle \(GAF\) is right because \(\overline{GF}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{AF}\) (by definition).
   - We know \(AF = 4\) and \(AG = AH - HG = 14 - 27.8 = -13.8\) (note: this is the length, we disregard the negative sign caused by the direction we took).
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     GF = \sqrt{AG^2 - AF^2} = \sqrt{13.8^2 - 4^2} = \sqrt{190.44 - 16} = \sqrt{174.44}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     GF \approx 13.2
     \]

Therefore, the length of \(\overline{GF}\) is approximately \(13.2\) units.

To solve for the measure of angle \(ACD\), we need to use a few geometric properties related to circles and triangles. Here's how we'll proceed:

1. **Identify Known Angles and Properties**: We know that \(AC = AB\) (given) and angle \(BAC = 42\) degrees (given). Since \(AC = AB\), triangle \(ABC\) is an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal, meaning angles \(ABC\) and \(ACB\) are equal.

2. **Find the Measure of Angle \(ACB\)**: Since the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180\) degrees, we can find the measure of angle \(ACB\) as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
BAC + ABC + ACB & = 180 \text{ degrees (sum of angles in a triangle)}\\
42 + ABC + ACB & = 180\\
42 + 2(ACB) & = 180 \text{ (since } ABC = ACB \text{ in an isosceles triangle)}\\
2(ACB) & = 138\\
ACB & = 69 \text{ degrees}
\end{align*}
\]

3. **Utilize the Properties of a Tangent**: Segment \(ED\) is a tangent to the circle at point \(C\). One of the properties of a tangent to a circle is that it is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency. Therefore, angle \(DCE\) is \(90\) degrees.

4. **Apply the Exterior Angle Theorem**: In triangle \(ABC\), angle \(ACD\) is an exterior angle at vertex \(C\). The Exterior Angle Theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, 

\[
ACD = BAC + ABC
\]

Given \(BAC = 42\) degrees and \(ABC = 69\) degrees (from our previous calculation), we can find \(ACD\) as follows:

\[
ACD = 42 + 69 = 111 \text{ degrees}
\]

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the measure of angle \(ACD\) is \(111\) degrees.

To solve for the value of $s=\sqrt{a+b\sqrt{2}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we need to determine the lengths of the legs $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BC}$ in the right triangle $\triangle{ABC}$. Since $\triangle{ABC}$ is an isosceles right triangle, we know the legs are of equal length. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Use Heron's Formula to Find the Area of $\triangle{APB}$ and $\triangle{BPC}$:**
    - Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides of length $x$, $y$, and $z$ is $\sqrt{s*(s-x)*(s-y)*(s-z)}$, where $s = \frac{x+y+z}{2}$ is the semi-perimeter.
    - For $\triangle{APB}$, we have $x = 11$, $y = 7$, and $z = AP$ (unknown).
    - For $\triangle{BPC}$, we have $x = 7$, $y = 6$, and $z = BP$ (unknown).

However, finding the actual values of the areas of $\triangle{APB}$ and $\triangle{BPC}$ isn't necessary because we can relate these areas to the area of $\triangle{ABC}$ in step 2.

2. **Relate the Areas to the Area of $\triangle{ABC}$:**
    - We know that the area of $\triangle{ABC}$ can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of $\triangle{APB}$, $\triangle{APC}$, and $\triangle{BPC}$ because point $P$ is inside $\triangle{ABC}$.
    - Additionally, since $\triangle{ABC}$ is an isosceles right triangle, its area can be expressed as $\frac{1}{2}s^2$ where $s$ is the length of one leg.

3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem or Triangle Inequality:**
    - Given the nature of the values provided and the geometric constraints, we might be able to use the Pythagorean theorem or the triangle inequality directly or indirectly to find more relationships among the sides. However, this can be complex because it involves inequalities or systems of quadratic equations.

Instead of going through the complex calculations and assumptions that steps 1 and 3 would require, there's a more straightforward geometric approach that uses the properties of isosceles right triangles and the triangle area ratios. Here's how:

1. **Use the Property of Isosceles Right Triangles:**
    - In an isosceles right triangle, the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ times longer than each leg. However, since $\triangle{ABC}$'s legs are equal, the hypotenuse is irrelevant in this scenario.

2. **Relate the Areas of $\triangle{APC}$ and $\triangle{BPC}$ to $\triangle{ABC}$:**
    - The key observation here is that $\triangle{APC}$ and $\triangle{BPC}$ are also isosceles right triangles. This is because triangle $\triangle{ABC}$ is isosceles with a right angle at $C$, and points $A$, $B$, and $P$ are all on the circle with diameter $\overline{AB}$.
    - Since $\triangle{APC}$ and $\triangle{BPC}$ share the same base $\overline{PC}$, their heights to $\overline{PC}$ are in the same ratio as their areas. Also, these heights are segments of $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BC}$, respectively.
    - Therefore, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle{APC}$ and $\triangle{BPC}$ is equal to the ratio of the segments of $\overline{AC}$ (or $\overline{BC}$) because $\triangle{ABC}$ is isosceles.
    - Given $PA=11$ and $PB=7$, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle{APC}$ to $\triangle{BPC}$ is $(11^2):(7^2)$, or $121:49$.

3. **Calculate the Segments of $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BC}$:**
    - Let's denote the point where the altitude from $P$ meets $\overline{AC}$ as $D$. So, we have $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{DC}$ as the segments of $\overline{AC}$.
    - Given the area ratio of $121:49$, we can set up the proportion $\frac{\overline{AD}}{\overline{DC}} = \frac{121}{49}$.
    - Since $\overline{AD} + \overline{DC} = s$, we can solve this system of equations to find $s$.

4. **Solve for $s$:**
    - From the proportion $\frac{\overline{AD}}{\overline{DC}} = \frac{121}{49}$, we have $\overline{AD} = \frac{121}{49}\overline{DC}$.
    - Substituting into $\overline{AD} + \overline{DC} = s$, we have $\frac{121}{49}\overline{DC} + \overline{DC} = s$.
    - Solving for $\overline{DC}$, we get $\overline{DC} = \frac{49}{170}s$.
    - Therefore, $\overline{AD} = s - \overline{DC} = s - \frac{49}{170}s = \frac{121}{170}s$.
    - Now, we know $\triangle{APC}$ is a right triangle, so using the Pythagorean theorem, we get $(\frac{121}{170}s)^2 + 6^2 = 11^2$.
    - Solving for $s$, we find $s^2 = 170 + 2*49 = 170 + 98 = 268$, so $s = \sqrt{268} = \sqrt{134+134\sqrt{2}}$.
  
From the final expression for $s$, we have $a = 134$ and $b = 134$. Therefore, $a + b = 134 + 134 = 268$.

To find the area of rectangle ABCD, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle is 1/2 the product of its base and height. Because triangles ABE, ADF, and CEF share the same height as the rectangle (since they are inside the rectangle), we can set up relationships between their areas and the dimensions of the rectangle.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the rectangle as follows: let the length of AB (and consequently CD) be "h" (for height), and the length of BC (and consequently AD) be "b" (for base).

1. Triangle ABE shares base AB with the rectangle, and has the same height (perpendicular to BC). So, the area of triangle ABE (which is 8) is 1/2 * h * BE. We don't know BE yet, but we'll find a relationship soon.

2. Triangle ADF has base AD (which is equal to BC, or "b"), and also shares the same height with the rectangle. So, its area (which is 5) is 1/2 * b * DF. We don't know DF yet.

3. Triangle CEF doesn't share a base with the rectangle, but it's inside the rectangle, sharing the same height "h". Its area (which is 9) is 1/2 * CF * h. We don't know CF yet, but CF = BC - BE (since BE + CF = BC).

Now, we'll use the fact that triangle ABE and triangle CEF together form triangle BCE, which shares the same base and height with the rectangle. So, the area of triangle BCE is 1/2 * BC * h, which is also the sum of the areas of triangles ABE and CEF (8 + 9 = 17).

Thus, 1/2 * b * h = 17. Since b is the base of the rectangle and h is the height, we have the formula for the area of the rectangle being b * h. So, the area of the rectangle must be 2 * 17 = 34.

To confirm this, we can find that the area of triangle ADF (5) plus the area of triangle CEF (9) equals 14, which is the area of triangle CDF. Since triangle CDF and triangle ABF together form the rectangle, and the area of triangle ABF is 20 (because it's the area of triangle BCE (17) plus the area of triangle ABE (8) minus the area of triangle CEF (9)), the total area of the rectangle is 14 (CDF) + 20 (ABF) = 34.

So, the area of rectangle ABCD is indeed 34.

Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Reflection of Point A across the x-axis**: 

    - The original point is \(A(3,3)\).
    - When a point is reflected across the x-axis, the x-coordinate remains the same, and the y-coordinate changes its sign. This is because the x-axis is the line y=0, and when you reflect something across this line, the position above/below the line (i.e., the y-coordinate) becomes the same distance below/above the line, respectively.
    - So, the reflection of point \(A\) across the x-axis is \(A'(3, -3)\).

2. **Translation of Point A' two units to the left**: 

    - Translation involves shifting a point a certain distance in a specified direction. In this case, we're shifting the point two units to the left.
    - Moving a point to the left or right affects the x-coordinate (left/right movement on the Cartesian plane). Specifically, moving a point to the left decreases the x-coordinate.
    - So, moving \(A'(3, -3)\) two units to the left means we will subtract 2 from the x-coordinate.
    - This gives us the new point \(A''(3-2, -3) = A''(1, -3)\).

Now, you're asked for the value of \(x + y\) for the coordinates of \(A''(x,y)\). 

Given \(A''(1, -3)\), we have \(x = 1\) and \(y = -3\).

So, 
\[x + y = 1 + (-3) = 1 - 3 = -2.\]

The value of \(x + y\) is \(-2\).

This problem is a bit involved because it requires understanding of both geometry and trigonometry. We're dealing with a greeting card being opened, changing from a flat shape to a conical section (because the card doesn't open fully flat, but at a 45-degree angle). Here's how we can solve it:

1. **Understanding the Setup:**
   - When the card is closed, points A and B are on top of each other, so their distance is 0.
   - When the card is fully opened to 45 degrees, point A remains stationary, but point B moves along the arc of a circle. This is because the fold acts as a hinge, and the motion describes a circle segment or sector.

2. **Finding the Radius of the Circle:**
   - The fold of the card acts as the radius of the circle. Since point A is 3 inches from the fold and point B is at the edge, the full radius, R, of the circle that point B travels along is the full width of the card, which is 6 inches.

3. **Determining the Arc Length for Point B:**
   - The card opens to 45 degrees, which is 45/360 = 1/8 of a full circle.
   - The circumference of the full circle would be C = 2 * π * R = 2 * π * 6.
   - So, the arc length that point B travels, being 1/8 of the total circumference, is (1/8) * 2 * π * 6 = (1/4) * π * 6.

4. **Determining the Arc Length for Point A:**
   - Point A is 3 inches from the fold, so the radius of the circle that point A would travel along (if it moved) is 3 inches.
   - However, point A doesn't move (the problem tells us it's stationary). Therefore, its arc length is 0.

5. **Calculating the Difference:**
   - The difference in the arc lengths that points A and B travel is just the arc length of point B, since point A's arc length is 0.
   - From step 3, point B's arc length is (1/4) * π * 6.

Therefore, point B travels \((1/4) * π * 6 = \frac{3}{2} * π\) inches more than point A. This is the final answer.

To determine what percent of rectangle ABCD is shaded, we first need to find the area of the entire rectangle and then the area of the shaded regions. Once we have both areas, we can find the percentage of the rectangle that is shaded by dividing the total shaded area by the total area of the rectangle and multiplying by 100. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangle**: We know that the rectangle is four times as long as it is wide. Let's assign a variable to the width. If the width is "w," then the length is "4w." 

2. **Find the area of the rectangle ABCD**: The area of a rectangle is length times width, so the area of rectangle ABCD is \(w \times 4w = 4w^2\).

3. **Identify the triangles**: We can see that there are two right triangles in the shaded region. Triangle ABE and triangle DCE. Point E is the midpoint of line BC, so BE is half the length of BC. Since BC is the length of the rectangle, BE = 2w. Also, since AE and DE are the widths of the rectangle, AE = DE = w.

4. **Calculate the area of the triangles**: The area of a right triangle is \(\frac{1}{2}\) base times height. For both triangles ABE and DCE, the base is BE (or CE) which is 2w, and the height is AE (or DE) which is w. 

   The area of triangle ABE is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2w \times w = w^2\).
   
   The area of triangle DCE is the same as ABE, so it's also \(w^2\).

5. **Calculate the total shaded area**: The total shaded area is the sum of the areas of triangle ABE and triangle DCE. So, \(w^2 + w^2 = 2w^2\).

6. **Find the percentage of the rectangle that is shaded**: Now, we divide the total shaded area by the total area of the rectangle and multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

   \(\frac{2w^2}{4w^2} \times 100 = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50%\).

So, 50% of rectangle ABCD is shaded.

To find the ratio of the area of triangle BDC to the area of triangle ADC, we need to use the information given in the diagram and some trigonometric properties. 

Here are the steps:

1. **Recognize the known angles and sides:**
   The angle at point A is given as 30 degrees. Since the triangle ABC is a right triangle (as indicated by the right angle marks), angle ACB is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle BAC must be 60 degrees (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees).

2. **Determine the other angles:**
   The line AD is an altitude of triangle ABC because it meets the opposite side (BC) at a right angle. Therefore, angle BDA must be 90 degrees. Also, since angle BAC is 60 degrees and angle BDA is 90 degrees, angle ABD must be 30 degrees, making triangle ABD a 30-60-90 right triangle.

3. **Understand the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:**
   In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the lengths of the sides opposite the 30-degree angle, the 60-degree angle, and the 90-degree angle is 1:√3:2, respectively. Here, side AB is opposite the 60-degree angle, AD is opposite the 30-degree angle, and BD is the hypotenuse.

4. **Apply the properties to the triangles in question:**
   Because AB is twice the length of AD (from the 1:√3:2 ratio), and triangle BDC shares side BD with triangle ABD, the sides of triangle BDC are also in the ratio 1:√3:2. However, we're concerned with the areas of the triangles BDC and ADC, not the side lengths directly.

5. **Find the area of the triangles:**
   The area of a triangle is 0.5 * base * height. In both triangles BDC and ADC, the altitude (height) is the same, AD. However, the bases are different: the base of BDC is BC, and the base of ADC is AC. 

   - Since AB is twice AD, and BC is √3 times AD (from the 30-60-90 triangle side ratios), the area of triangle BDC is 0.5 * BC * AD = 0.5 * AD * (√3 * AD) = 0.5 * AD^2 * √3.
   - The area of triangle ADC is 0.5 * AC * AD. But AC = AB (because both are sides opposite the 60-degree angles in 30-60-90 triangles), so AC = 2 * AD. Therefore, the area of triangle ADC = 0.5 * (2 * AD) * AD = AD^2.

6. **Calculate the ratio of the areas:**
   The ratio of the area of triangle BDC to the area of triangle ADC is (0.5 * AD^2 * √3) / AD^2 = 0.5 * √3.

7. **Simplify the ratio:**
   0.5 * √3 = (1/2) * √3 = √3/2. However, we're asked to express the answer as a common fraction. √3 is approximately 1.732, so √3/2 is approximately 1.732/2 = 0.866. This is not a number that simplifies to a nice fraction, but it's the ratio of the areas of the triangles.

   So, the ratio of the area of triangle BDC to the area of triangle ADC is approximately 0.866, which doesn't simplify to a cleaner fraction. If we're considering exact forms, we'd keep it as √3/2.

To solve this problem, we'll use our knowledge of the properties of squares, equilateral triangles, and angles.

Here are the key properties and facts we're going to use:

1. All angles in a square are right angles (90 degrees).
2. All sides of a square are equal.
3. All angles in an equilateral triangle are equal, and each is 60 degrees since the total must sum up to 180 degrees (the sum of angles in any triangle).
4. When two lines intersect, the opposite (vertical) angles are equal.

Now let's analyze the figure step by step:

1. Since $BEFG$ is a square, angle $BEG$ is a right angle (90 degrees).
2. $BCE$ is an equilateral triangle, so each of its angles, including angle $BEC$, is 60 degrees.
3. Now, let's find angle $CEG$. Since a straight line is 180 degrees, we subtract the angle $BEC$ (60 degrees) from 180 degrees because angle $BEC$ and angle $CEG$ are supplementary angles (they add up to form a straight line, $BE$):
   - $CEG = 180 degrees - BEC = 180 degrees - 60 degrees = 120 degrees$

So, angle $GCE$ is part of a triangle formed by points $G$, $C$, and $E$. We know two angles in this triangle: $GCE = 120$ degrees (just calculated) and $ECG = 90$ degrees (since $BEFG$ is a square and $ECG$ is a right angle).

Since the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can find angle $GEC$ by subtracting the sum of angles $GCE$ and $ECG$ from 180 degrees:

- $GEC = 180 degrees - GCE - ECG = 180 degrees - 120 degrees - 90 degrees = -30 degrees$

However, an angle cannot be negative, which indicates that there might be an error in our previous steps. Let's go back and re-evaluate the figure and our calculations.

The mistake lies in the calculation of angle $CEG$. Angle $BEC$ is indeed 60 degrees, but angle $CEG$ should be calculated as the difference between 180 degrees (straight line) and angle $BEG$ (right angle, 90 degrees), not $BEC$.

- $CEG = 180 degrees - BEG = 180 degrees - 90 degrees = 90 degrees$

Now, let's recalculate angle $GEC$ in the triangle $GCE$:

- $GEC = 180 degrees - GCE - ECG = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 90 degrees = 0 degrees$

This result doesn't make sense either because angle $GEC$ clearly isn't 0 degrees. We made a mistake in assigning 90 degrees to angle $GCE$. The correct assignment is to angle $CEG$, which is between the sides of the squares and is thus a right angle.

Correcting this:

- $GCE = 90 degrees$ (since $CEG$ is the right angle, not $GCE$)
- $ECG = 60 degrees$ (angle of the equilateral triangle)

Now, let's find angle $GEC$:

- $GEC = 180 degrees - GCE - ECG = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 60 degrees = 30 degrees$

So, angle $GEC$ is 30 degrees.

The problem involves a rectangle divided into five smaller congruent rectangles, and we're tasked with finding the perimeter of one of the smaller rectangles. The original rectangle's perimeter is given as 176 units. Here's how to solve the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The original rectangle is divided into five smaller rectangles that are congruent (identical in shape and size). This means that each small rectangle has the same width and the same height. The term "perimeter" refers to the total distance around a two-dimensional shape.

2. **Analyze the Given Rectangle's Perimeter:**
   The perimeter of the original rectangle is given as 176 units. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as:
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w
   \]
   where \(P\) is the perimeter, \(l\) is the length, and \(w\) is the width of the rectangle. However, we don't have the individual values of length and width for the original rectangle; we only know the total perimeter.

3. **Examine the Small Rectangles:**
   Since the original rectangle is divided into five congruent rectangles, and they appear to be aligned such that we have 3 rectangles' widths making up the original rectangle's total width and 2 rectangles' lengths making up the original rectangle's total length. This is deduced from the diagram provided.

4. **Formulate Relationships:**
   Let's assume the width of one of the smaller rectangles is \(w_s\) and the length is \(l_s\). From the diagram and our analysis, we can establish these relationships:
   - The total width of the original rectangle (\(W\)) is 3 times the width of the smaller rectangle (\(w_s\)): \(W = 3w_s\).
   - The total length of the original rectangle (\(L\)) is 2 times the length of the smaller rectangle (\(l_s\)): \(L = 2l_s\).

5. **Express the Original Rectangle's Perimeter in Terms of Smaller Rectangles' Dimensions:**
   Given the relationships in step 4 and the perimeter formula in step 2, we can express the original rectangle's perimeter in terms of \(w_s\) and \(l_s\):
   \[
   176 = 2L + 2W = 2(2l_s) + 2(3w_s) = 4l_s + 6w_s
   \]
   
6. **Calculate the Perimeter of a Smaller Rectangle:**
   The perimeter of one of the smaller rectangles (\(P_s\)) would be:
   \[
   P_s = 2l_s + 2w_s
   \]
   However, we need to find the values of \(l_s\) and \(w_s\) from the equation we've derived in step 5.

7. **Solve for \(l_s\) and \(w_s\):**
   We only have one equation from step 5 but two unknowns. This means we can't find unique values for \(l_s\) and \(w_s\), but we don't need to; we only need their sum, because that's what's relevant for the perimeter of the smaller rectangle. 
   - From the equation in step 5, we get the sum of \(l_s\) and \(w_s\) as follows:
     \[
     4l_s + 6w_s = 176 \implies 2l_s + 3w_s = 88 \implies l_s + w_s = 44/2 \implies l_s + w_s = 22
     \]

8. **Find the Perimeter of the Smaller Rectangle:**
   Now that we know \(l_s + w_s = 22\), we can find the perimeter of one of the smaller rectangles using the equation from step 6:
   \[
   P_s = 2l_s + 2w_s = 2(l_s + w_s) = 2(22) = 44
   \]

So, the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is 44 units.

To solve this problem, we'll use several geometric properties related to right triangles, medians, and altitudes. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have right triangle ABC with ∠B = 90°. Point D is the midpoint of AC because BD is a median, and BE is perpendicular to AC because BE is an altitude. We know BD = 2·DE, and we are asked to find the ratio AB/EC.

2. **Median Property**: Since BD is a median, D is the midpoint of AC, so AD = DC. Let's assume AD = DC = x.

3. **Altitude and Length Relations**: Because BE is an altitude and it meets AC at E, we have two smaller right triangles, ABE and CBE. Also, since BD = 2·DE, we can say BE = 2·DE - ED = DE (because D is the midpoint of AC, and so DE = ED).

4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**: We can apply the Pythagorean theorem in triangles ABE and BCE to find expressions for AB and EC in terms of DE (or ED) and BE.

   In triangle ABE:
   \(AB^2 = AE^2 + BE^2\)
   \(AB^2 = (DE + ED)^2 + BE^2 = (2DE)^2 + (DE)^2 = 5DE^2\)
   \(AB = DE\sqrt{5}\)

   In triangle BCE:
   \(BC^2 = CE^2 + BE^2\)
   \(BC^2 = CE^2 + DE^2\)
   But we know BC = BA (because ABC is an isosceles right triangle as AD = DC = x and D is the midpoint),
   \(BA^2 = CE^2 + DE^2\)
   \(5DE^2 = CE^2 + DE^2\)
   \(4DE^2 = CE^2\)
   \(CE = 2DE\)

5. **Finding the Ratio**: Now we have expressions for AB and EC in terms of DE. We can find the ratio AB/EC:

   \(\frac{AB}{EC} = \frac{DE\sqrt{5}}{2DE} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\)

So, the ratio of AB to EC is \(\sqrt{5}/2\).

Given that each triangle in the figure is an isosceles right triangle, and the length of line segment $\overline{BC}$ is 2 units, we'll calculate the perimeter of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ step by step.

1. First, let's consider the properties of an isosceles right triangle. In such a triangle, the two legs are of equal length, and the hypotenuse is the line segment opposite the right angle. Since the angles in an isosceles right triangle are 45°-45°-90°, the relationship between the length of the legs (let's denote the leg's length as "a") and the hypotenuse ("h") is given by the Pythagorean theorem:

   \(a^2 + a^2 = h^2\)

   Simplifying, we find:

   \(2a^2 = h^2\)

   \(h = a\sqrt{2}\)

2. Next, we look at the line segment $\overline{BC}$, which is given as 2 units. $\overline{BC}$ is the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle where the two legs are of equal length. Using the relationship derived above, we can express the length of each leg of this triangle in terms of the hypotenuse:

   \(h = a\sqrt{2}\)

   \(a = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}\) after rationalizing the denominator.

   So, each leg of the triangle with hypotenuse $\overline{BC}$ has a length of $\sqrt{2}$ units.

3. Now, we need to determine the lengths of $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{DA}$ to find the perimeter of quadrilateral $ABCD$.

- $\overline{BC}$ has already been given as 2 units.
- $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ are each the sum of two legs from two different isosceles right triangles, each of which is $\sqrt{2}$ units (as calculated above). Therefore, each of these sides has a length of \(2\sqrt{2}\) units.
- $\overline{DA}$, however, is the hypotenuse of a larger isosceles right triangle. The legs of this larger triangle are the same length as $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$, which is \(2\sqrt{2}\) units. Using the relationship between the leg and the hypotenuse in an isosceles right triangle, the length of $\overline{DA}$ is:

   \(h = a\sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\) units.

4. Finally, we find the perimeter of quadrilateral $ABCD$ by summing the lengths of its sides:

   \(P = \overline{AB} + \overline{BC} + \overline{CD} + \overline{DA}\)

   \(P = 2\sqrt{2} + 2 + 2\sqrt{2} + 4 = 4\sqrt{2} + 6\)

So, the perimeter of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is \(4\sqrt{2} + 6\) units in simplest radical form.

To find the area of the shaded region, we'll first calculate the area of the large semicircle and then subtract the areas of the smaller semicircles. The area left will be the area of the shaded region.

1. **Area of the large semicircle:**
   The radius of the large semicircle is 2. The formula for the area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\), but since we're dealing with a semicircle, we'll take half of this value. So, the area of the semicircle is \(\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = 2\pi\).

2. **Area of a small semicircle:**
   The radius of each small semicircle is 1. Using the same logic as above, the area of one small semicircle is \(\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (1)^2 = \frac{1}{2}\pi\).

3. **Total area of the small semicircles:**
   There are three small semicircles, each with an area of \(\frac{1}{2}\pi\). So, the total area for all three small semicircles is \(3 \times \frac{1}{2}\pi = \frac{3}{2}\pi\).

4. **Area of the shaded region:**
   The shaded region is the area of the large semicircle minus the total area of the three small semicircles. So, we subtract the total area of the small semicircles from the area of the large semicircle: \(2\pi - \frac{3}{2}\pi = \frac{1}{2}\pi\).

So, the area of the shaded region that lies within the large semicircle but outside the smaller semicircles is \(\frac{1}{2}\pi\) square units.

The problem involves geometric reasoning. We have two squares, $ABCD$ and $EFGH$, which are equal in area. The goal is to determine the fraction of the combined area of these two squares that is shaded. Let's denote the side of each square as "s" and, consequently, the area of each square as $s^2$. Since the squares have equal area, the combined area of the two squares is $2s^2$.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Understand the Diagram:**
   - Square $ABCD$ is positioned with side $BC$ on a line.
   - Square $EFGH$ is positioned such that vertices $B$, $E$, $C$, and $H$ are on the same line, meaning that side $EH$ is collinear with $BC$ and, consequently, sides $BC$ and $EH$ are on the same line.
   - Diagonal $AC$ of square $ABCD$ is extended to point $J$, which is the midpoint of side $GH$ of square $EFGH$.

2. **Determine the Shaded Areas:**
   - There are two shaded triangles in the figure. 
     - Triangle $ACD$ is half of square $ABCD$, so its area is $0.5s^2$.
     - Triangle $CHJ$ is a right triangle located within square $EFGH$.

3. **Analyze Triangle $CHJ$:**
   - We know that $J$ is the midpoint of $GH$. Since $GH$ is a side of the square, its length is $s$. Therefore, $HJ = GJ = 0.5s$.
   - Side $CH$ is a side of the square, so it also has a length of $s$.
   - Thus, triangle $CHJ$ is a right triangle with base $HJ = 0.5s$ and height $CH = s$.

4. **Calculate the Area of Triangle $CHJ$:**
   - The area of a right triangle is given by $0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$.
   - The area of triangle $CHJ$ is $0.5 \times 0.5s \times s = 0.25s^2$.

5. **Calculate the Total Shaded Area:**
   - The total shaded area is the sum of the areas of triangles $ACD$ and $CHJ$.
   - Total shaded area = $0.5s^2 + 0.25s^2 = 0.75s^2$.

6. **Determine the Fraction of the Shaded Area:**
   - The total area of the two squares is $2s^2$.
   - The fraction of the shaded area is the total shaded area divided by the total area of the squares.
   - Fraction = Total shaded area / Total area of squares = $0.75s^2 / 2s^2$.

7. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   - Fraction = $0.75/2 = 0.375$.

So, the fraction of the two squares that is shaded is $0.375$ or $3/8$.

Alright, let's begin by analyzing the given triangle, \( \triangle XYZ \).

The area of an isosceles triangle can be determined using the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Given:
Base, \( XY = 30 \)
Area, \( \triangle XYZ = 120 \)

Let's find the height of \( \triangle XYZ \).

Let the foot of the perpendicular from Y to the base XY be M. Now, \( YM \) will be the height.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle XYM \):
\[ XM^2 + YM^2 = XY^2 \]
\[ XM^2 + YM^2 = 17^2 \]
\[ XM^2 + YM^2 = 289 \]

Since \( XM = \frac{XY}{2} = 15 \), we have:
\[ 15^2 + YM^2 = 289 \]
\[ YM^2 = 289 - 225 \]
\[ YM^2 = 64 \]

Thus, \( YM = 8 \).

Now, plugging this value into our area formula for \( \triangle XYZ \):
\[ 120 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times 8 \]

Which confirms the given details for \( \triangle XYZ \).

For the second triangle, let's call it \( \triangle ABC \), with \( AB = BC \) (isosceles sides) and \( AC \) as the base.

Given the same area, the relationship between the base and the height is:
\[ 120 = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times h \]
\[ AC \times h = 240 \]
\[ h = \frac{240}{AC} \]

The height would bisect the base AC into two equal parts, let's call the point where the height meets AC as D. 

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABD \):
\[ AD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2 \]
\[ (\frac{AC}{2})^2 + h^2 = AB^2 \]

Substitute \( h = \frac{240}{AC} \) into the equation:
\[ (\frac{AC}{2})^2 + (\frac{240}{AC})^2 = AB^2 \]

To find integer values for the sides, we can test the possible values of AC such that \( AC < 30 \) (because the other triangle already has a base of 30).

On testing:
For \( AC = 16 \) (since \( 16 \times 15 = 240 \), which is a factor pair of 240), the height becomes 15.

\[ (\frac{16}{2})^2 + 15^2 = AB^2 \]
\[ 8^2 + 15^2 = AB^2 \]
\[ 64 + 225 = AB^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 289 \]

Which means \( AB = 17 \).

Thus, \( \triangle ABC \) has side lengths of 17, 17, and 16. 

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ 17 + 17 + 16 = 50 \]

Thus, the perimeter of the second triangle is \( \boxed{50} \).

To determine the fraction of the square that is shaded, we first need to understand the structure of the square and the lines within it. The square is divided by its diagonals, which further subdivide it into four smaller, equal-sized right triangles. Additionally, there are two lines drawn from the midpoints of the bottom side of the square to the diagonal lines, further subdividing the square.

Here's a step-by-step approach to calculate the shaded area:

1. **Identify the whole area**: The entire square is our whole unit - it represents the "whole" in terms of which we're trying to express the shaded area as a fraction. We don't know the exact dimensions of the square, but we don't need them; we're just interested in the fraction of the area that is shaded.

2. **Recognize symmetrical triangles**: The square is divided into 8 smaller triangles of equal area by its diagonals and the two lines from the midpoints of the bottom side. This is because the main diagonals of the square divide it into 4 equal areas, and the additional lines halve two of these areas. 

3. **Identify the shaded area**: The shaded area consists of four of these small triangles (you can visualize this by seeing the four triangles meet at the center, forming a larger one).

4. **Calculate the fraction**: If the entire square is divided into 8 equal-area triangles, and 4 of these are shaded, the shaded area is 4 out of 8 parts of the square. 

So, the fraction of the square that is shaded is 4/8. However, this fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

4/8 = 1/2

Thus, the shaded area is 1/2 (or one-half) of the total area of the square.

Given a cube with edge length \( s \), we have the following relationships:

1. Surface area: \( 6s^2 \)
2. Volume: \( s^3 \)
3. Edge length: \( s \)

According to the problem statement, the surface area of the cube is equal to the sum of its volume and five times its edge length:

\[ 6s^2 = s^3 + 5s \]

To solve this cubic equation, you can rearrange it as:

\[ s^3 - 6s^2 + 5s = 0 \]

You can factor out an \( s \):

\[ s(s^2 - 6s + 5) = 0 \]

This gives us one root immediately:

\[ s = 0 \]

However, \( s > 0 \) as per the problem statement, so we will ignore this solution.

Now we need to solve the quadratic equation:

\[ s^2 - 6s + 5 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[ s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -6 \), and \( c = 5 \), we get:

\[ s = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(5)}}{2} \]
\[ s = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 20}}{2} \]
\[ s = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2} \]
\[ s = \frac{6 \pm 4}{2} \]

This gives two solutions:

1. \( s = \frac{6 + 4}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \)
2. \( s = \frac{6 - 4}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Both of these solutions are greater than 0, so they are valid.

To find the sum of all possible values of \( s \):

\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \]

So, the sum of all possible values of \( s \) is 6.
